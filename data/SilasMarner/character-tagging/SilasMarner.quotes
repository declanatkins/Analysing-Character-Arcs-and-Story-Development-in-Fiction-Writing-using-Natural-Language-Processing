3970	4044	3966	3967	the minister	334	" The proof is heavy against you , brother Marner . The money was taken in the night last past , and no man was with our departed brother but you , for William Dane declares to us that he was hindered by sudden sickness from going to take his place as usual , and you yourself said that he had not come ; and , moreover , you neglected the dead body .

10268	10288	10290	10290	Godfrey	61	" Why , this is what I want - and just shake yourself sober and listen , will you ? "
10315	10452	10296	10296	himself	61	" I want to tell you , I must hand over that rent of Fowler 's to the Squire , or else tell him I gave it you ; for he 's threatening to distrain for it , and it 'll all be out soon , whether I tell him or not . He said , just now , before he went out , he should send word to Cox to distrain , if Fowler did n't come and pay up his arrears this week . The Squire 's short o ' cash , and in no humour to stand any nonsense ; and you know what he threatened , if ever he found you making away with his money again . So , see and get the money , and pretty quickly , will you ? "
10453	10456	10458	10458	Dunsey	59	" Oh ! "
10473	10532	10458	10458	Dunsey	59	" Suppose , now , you get the money yourself , and save me the trouble , eh ? Since you was so kind as to hand it over to me , you 'll not refuse me the kindness to pay it back for me : it was your brotherly love made you do it , you know . "
10542	10559	10533	10533	Godfrey	61	" Do n't come near me with that look , else I 'll knock you down . "
10560	10568	10570	10570	Dunsey	59	" Oh no , you wo n't , "
10580	10701	10570	10570	Dunsey	59	" Because I 'm such a good - natured brother , you know . I might get you turned out of house and home , and cut off with a shilling any day . I might tell the Squire how his handsome son was married to that nice young woman , Molly Farren , and was very unhappy because he could n't live with his drunken wife , and I should slip into your place as comfortable as could be . But you see , I do n't do it - I'm so easy and good - natured . You 'll take any trouble for me . You 'll get the hundred pounds for me - I know you will . "
10702	10710	10712	10712	Godfrey	61	" How can I get the money ? "
10716	10786	10712	10712	Godfrey	61	" I have n't a shilling to bless myself with . And it 's a lie that you 'd slip into my place : you 'd get yourself turned out too , that 's all . For if you begin telling tales , I 'll follow . Bob 's my father 's favourite - you know that very well . He 'd only think himself well rid of you . "
10787	10791	10793	10793	Dunsey	59	" Never mind , "
10807	10899	10800	10800	he	59	" It ' ud be very pleasant to me to go in your company - you're such a handsome brother , and we 've always been so fond of quarrelling with one another , I should n't know what to do without you . But you 'd like better for us both to stay at home together ; I know you would . So you 'll manage to get that little sum o ' money , and I 'll bid you good - bye , though I 'm sorry to part . "
10922	10938	10906	10906	Godfrey	61	" I tell you , I have no money : I can get no money . "

10967	10975	10906	10906	Godfrey	61	" Well , then , sell Wildfire . "
10976	10991	10906	10906	Godfrey	61	" Yes , that 's easy talking . I must have the money directly . "
10992	11028	10906	10906	Godfrey	61	" Well , you 've only got to ride him to the hunt to - morrow . There 'll be Bryce and Keating there , for sure . You 'll get more bids than one . "
11029	11057	10906	10906	Godfrey	61	" I daresay , and get back home at eight o'clock , splashed up to the chin . I 'm going to Mrs. Osgood 's birthday dance . "

11132	11139	11127	11127	Godfrey	61	" else I 'll throttle you . "
11140	11144	11146	11146	Dunsey	59	" What for ? "
11173	11263	11146	11146	Dunsey	59	" You 've a very good chance . I 'd advise you to creep up her sleeve again : it ' ud be saving time , if Molly should happen to take a drop too much laudanum some day , and make a widower of you . Miss Nancy would n't mind being a second , if she did n't know it . And you 've got a good - natured brother , who 'll keep your secret well , because you 'll be so very obliging to him . "
11264	11273	11275	11275	Godfrey	61	" I 'll tell you what it is , "
11283	11449	11275	11275	Godfrey	61	" my patience is pretty near at an end . If you 'd a little more sharpness in you , you might know that you may urge a man a bit too far , and make one leap as easy as another . I do n't know but what it is so now : I may as well tell the Squire everything myself - I should get you off my back , if I got nothing else . And , after all , he 'll know some time . She 's been threatening to come herself and tell him . So , do n't flatter yourself that your secrecy 's worth any price you choose to ask . You drain me of money till I have got nothing to pacify _ her _ with , and she 'll do as she threatens some day . It 's all one . I 'll tell my father everything myself , and you may go to the devil . "

11973	12067	11964	11964	Godfrey	61	" to talk about my selling Wildfire in that cool way - the last thing I 've got to call my own , and the best bit of horse - flesh I ever had in my life . And if you 'd got a spark of pride in you , you 'd be ashamed to see the stables emptied , and everybody sneering about it . But it 's my belief you 'd sell yourself , if it was only for the pleasure of making somebody feel he 'd got a bad bargain . "
12068	12073	12075	12075	Dunstan	58	" Aye , aye , "
12080	12159	12075	12075	Dunstan	58	" you do me justice , I see . You know I 'm a jewel for ' ticing people into bargains . For which reason I advise you to let _ me _ sell Wildfire . I 'd ride him to the hunt to - morrow for you , with pleasure . I should n't look so handsome as you in the saddle , but it 's the horse they 'll bid for , and not the rider . "
12160	12172	11964	11964	Godfrey	61	" Yes , I daresay - trust my horse to you ! "
12173	12178	12180	12180	Dunstan	58	" As you please , "
12195	12314	12180	12180	Dunstan	58	" It 's _ you _ have got to pay Fowler 's money ; it 's none of my business . You received the money from him when you went to Bramcote , and _ you _ told the Squire it was n't paid . I 'd nothing to do with that ; you chose to be so obliging as to give it me , that was all . If you do n't want to pay the money , let it alone ; it 's all one to me . But I was willing to accommodate you by undertaking to sell the horse , seeing it 's not convenient to you to go so far to - morrow . "
12393	12468	12380	12380	he	61	" Well , you mean no nonsense about the horse , eh ? You 'll sell him all fair , and hand over the money ? If you do n't , you know , everything ' ull go to smash , for I 've got nothing else to trust to . And you 'll have less pleasure in pulling the house over my head , when your own skull 's to be broken too . "
12469	12474	12476	12476	Dunstan	58	" Aye , aye , "
12480	12522	12476	12476	Dunstan	58	" all right . I thought you 'd come round . I 'm the fellow to bring old Bryce up to the scratch . I 'll get you a hundred and twenty for him , if I get you a penny . "
12523	12548	12550	12550	Godfrey	61	" But it 'll perhaps rain cats and dogs to - morrow , as it did yesterday , and then you ca n't go , "
12563	12569	12571	12571	Dunstan	58	" Not _ it _ , "
12573	12641	12571	12571	Dunstan	58	" I 'm always lucky in my weather . It might rain if you wanted to go yourself . You never hold trumps , you know - I always do . You 've got the beauty , you see , and I 've got the luck , so you must keep me by you for your crooked sixpence ; you 'll _ ne_-ver get along without me . "
12642	12650	12652	12652	Godfrey	61	" Confound you , hold your tongue ! "
12656	12687	12652	12652	Godfrey	61	" And take care to keep sober to - morrow , else you 'll get pitched on your head coming home , and Wildfire might be the worse for it . "
12688	12695	12697	12697	Dunstan	58	" Make your tender heart easy , "
12703	12741	12697	12697	Dunstan	58	" You never knew me see double when I 'd got a bargain to make ; it ' ud spoil the fun . Besides , whenever I fall , I 'm warranted to fall on my legs . "

14649	14658	14660	14660	Dunstan	58	" Oh , I 've swopped with him , "

14692	14709	14711	14711	Bryce	69	" What ! has he swopped with you for that big - boned hack of yours ? "
14724	14735	14737	14737	Dunsey	59	" Oh , there was a little account between us , "
14741	14888	14737	14737	Dunsey	59	" and Wildfire made it even . I accommodated him by taking the horse , though it was against my will , for I 'd got an itch for a mare o ' Jortin's - as rare a bit o ' blood as ever you threw your leg across . But I shall keep Wildfire , now I 've got him , though I 'd a bid of a hundred and fifty for him the other day , from a man over at Flitton - he 's buying for Lord Cromleck - a fellow with a cast in his eye , and a green waistcoat . But I mean to stick to Wildfire : I sha n't get a better at a fence in a hurry . The mare 's got more blood , but she 's a bit too weak in the hind - quarters . "
14944	14998	14941	14941	Bryce	69	" I wonder at that now ; I wonder you mean to keep him ; for I never heard of a man who did n't want to sell his horse getting a bid of half as much again as the horse was worth . You 'll be lucky if you get a hundred . "

And for the matter o ' that , if the talk is to be o ' the Lammeters , _ you _ know the most upo ' that head , eh , Mr. Macey ?

21514	21549	21511	21512	Ben Winthrop	83	" We 'll pay you your share to keep out of it - that 's what we 'll do . There 's things folks ' ud pay to be rid on , besides varmin . "
21550	21555	21557	21558	the landlord	759	" Come , come , "
21575	21662	21557	21558	the landlord	759	" a joke 's a joke . We 're all good friends here , I hope . We must give and take . You 're both right and you 're both wrong , as I say . I agree wi ' Mr. Macey here , as there 's two opinions ; and if mine was asked , I should say they 're both right . Tookey 's right and Winthrop 's right , and they 've only got to split the difference and make themselves even . "
21739	21744	21745	21745	he	762	" To be sure , "
21756	21839	21745	21745	he	762	" we 're fond of our old clerk ; it 's nat'ral , and him used to be such a singer , and got a brother as is known for the first fiddler in this country - side . Eh , it 's a pity but what Solomon lived in our village , and could give us a tune when we liked ; eh , Mr. Macey ? I 'd keep him in liver and lights for nothing - that I would . "
21840	21845	21847	21848	Mr. Macey	36	" Aye , aye , "
21856	21917	21847	21848	Mr. Macey	36	" our family 's been known for musicianers as far back as anybody can tell . But them things are dying out , as I tell Solomon every time he comes round ; there 's no voices like what there used to be , and there 's nobody remembers what we remember , if it is n't the old crows . "
21918	21941	21943	21944	the landlord	759	" Aye , you remember when first Mr. Lammeter 's father come into these parts , do n't you , Mr. Macey ? "
21946	21953	21955	21957	the old man	329	" I should think I did , "
21978	22318	21955	21957	the old man	329	" and a fine old gentleman he was - as fine , and finer nor the Mr. Lammeter as now is . He came from a bit north'ard , so far as I could ever make out . But there 's nobody rightly knows about those parts : only it could n't be far north'ard , nor much different from this country , for he brought a fine breed o ' sheep with him , so there must be pastures there , and everything reasonable . We heared tell as he 'd sold his own land to come and take the Warrens , and that seemed odd for a man as had land of his own , to come and rent a farm in a strange place . But they said it was along of his wife 's dying ; though there 's reasons in things as nobody knows on - that 's pretty much what I 've made out ; yet some folks are so wise , they 'll find you fifty reasons straight off , and all the while the real reason 's winking at 'em in the corner , and they niver see't . Howsomever , it was soon seen as we 'd got a new parish'ner as know'd the rights and customs o ' things , and kep a good house , and was well looked on by everybody . And the young man - that 's the Mr. Lammeter as now is , for he 'd niver a sister - soon begun to court Miss Osgood , that 's the sister o ' the Mr. Osgood as now is , and a fine handsome lass she was - eh , you ca n't think - they pretend this young lass is like her , but that 's the way wi ' people as do n't know what come before 'em . _ I _ should know , for I helped the old rector , Mr. Drumlow as was , I helped him marry 'em . "
22340	22366	22368	22369	the landlord	759	" Aye , and a partic'lar thing happened , did n't it , Mr. Macey , so as you were likely to remember that marriage ? "
22376	22390	22392	22393	Mr. Macey	36	" I should think there did - a _ very _ partic'lar thing , "
22398	22537	22392	22393	Mr. Macey	36	" For Mr. Drumlow - poor old gentleman , I was fond on him , though he 'd got a bit confused in his head , what wi ' age and wi ' taking a drop o ' summat warm when the service come of a cold morning . And young Mr. Lammeter , he 'd have no way but he must be married in Janiwary , which , to be sure , 's a unreasonable time to be married in , for it is n't like a christening or a burying , as you ca n't help ; and so Mr. Drumlow - poor old gentleman , I was fond on him - but when he come to put the questions , he put 'em by the rule o ' contrairy , like , and he says , "
22548	22557	22539	22539	thou	807	" says he , and then he says , "
22568	22595	22539	22539	thou	807	" says he . But the partic'larest thing of all is , as nobody took any notice on it but me , and they answered straight off "
22597	22607	22539	22539	thou	807	" , like as if it had been me saying "
22609	22623	22539	22539	thou	807	" i ' the right place , without listening to what went before . "
22624	22651	22653	22654	the butcher	762	" But _ you _ knew what was going on well enough , did n't you , Mr. Macey ? You were live enough , eh ? "
22656	22661	22663	22664	Mr. Macey	36	" Lor bless you ! "
22679	22733	22663	22664	Mr. Macey	36	imagination-"why , I was all of a tremble : it was as if I 'd been a coat pulled by the two tails , like ; for I could n't stop the parson , I could n't take upon me to do that ; and yet I said to myself , I says , "
22748	22779	22663	22664	Mr. Macey	36	" and my head went working like a mill , for I was allays uncommon for turning things over and seeing all round 'em ; and I says to myself , "
22795	22861	22663	22664	Mr. Macey	36	" For the parson meant right , and the bride and bridegroom meant right . But then , when I come to think on it , meanin ' goes but a little way i ' most things , for you may mean to stick things together and your glue may be bad , and then where are you ? And so I says to mysen , "
22874	22928	22663	22664	Mr. Macey	36	" And I was worreted as if I 'd got three bells to pull at once , when we went into the vestry , and they begun to sign their names . But where 's the use o ' talking?-you ca n't think what goes on in a ' cute man 's inside . "
22929	22945	22947	22948	the landlord	759	" But you held in for all that , did n't you , Mr. Macey ? "
22950	22994	22663	22664	Mr. Macey	36	" Aye , I held in tight till I was by mysen wi ' Mr. Drumlow , and then I out wi ' everything , but respectful , as I allays did . And he made light on it , and he says , "
23005	23009	22663	22664	Mr. Macey	36	" he says ; "
23031	23125	22663	22664	Mr. Macey	36	" So you see he settled it easy ; for parsons and doctors know everything by heart , like , so as they are n't worreted wi ' thinking what 's the rights and wrongs o ' things , as I'n been many and many 's the time . And sure enough the wedding turned out all right , on'y poor Mrs. Lammeter - that 's Miss Osgood as was - died afore the lasses was growed up ; but for prosperity and everything respectable , there 's no family more looked on . "
23200	23223	23188	23189	Mr. Snell	76	" Why , old Mr. Lammeter had a pretty fortin , did n't they say , when he come into these parts ? "
23224	23229	23231	23232	Mr. Macey	36	" Well , yes , "
23234	23283	23231	23232	Mr. Macey	36	" but I daresay it 's as much as this Mr. Lammeter 's done to keep it whole . For there was allays a talk as nobody could get rich on the Warrens : though he holds it cheap , for it 's what they call Charity Land . "
23284	23310	23312	23313	the butcher	762	" Aye , and there 's few folks know so well as you how it come to be Charity Land , eh , Mr. Macey ? "
23315	23320	23322	23324	the old clerk	822	" How should they ? "
23330	23550	23551	23551	Macey	36	" Why , my grandfather made the grooms ' livery for that Mr. Cliff as came and built the big stables at the Warrens . Why , they 're stables four times as big as Squire Cass 's , for he thought o ' nothing but hosses and hunting , Cliff didn't - a Lunnon tailor , some folks said , as had gone mad wi ' cheating . For he could n't ride ; lor bless you ! they said he 'd got no more grip o ' the hoss than if his legs had been cross - sticks : my grandfather heared old Squire Cass say so many and many a time . But ride he would , as if Old Harry had been a - driving him ; and he 'd a son , a lad o ' sixteen ; and nothing would his father have him do , but he must ride and ride - though the lad was frighted , they said . And it was a common saying as the father wanted to ride the tailor out o ' the lad , and make a gentleman on him - not but what I 'm a tailor myself , but in respect as God made me such , I 'm proud on it , for "
23554	23811	24005	24006	the landlord	759	" , 's been wrote up over our door since afore the Queen 's heads went out on the shillings . But Cliff , he was ashamed o ' being called a tailor , and he was sore vexed as his riding was laughed at , and nobody o ' the gentlefolks hereabout could abide him . Howsomever , the poor lad got sickly and died , and the father did n't live long after him , for he got queerer nor ever , and they said he used to go out i ' the dead o ' the night , wi ' a lantern in his hand , to the stables , and set a lot o ' lights burning , for he got as he could n't sleep ; and there he 'd stand , cracking his whip and looking at his hosses ; and they said it was a mercy as the stables did n't get burnt down wi ' the poor dumb creaturs in 'em . But at last he died raving , and they found as he 'd left all his property , Warrens and all , to a Lunnon Charity , and that 's how the Warrens come to be Charity Land ; though , as for the stables , Mr. Lammeter never uses 'em - they're out o ' all charicter - lor bless you ! if you was to set the doors a - banging in 'em , it ' ud sound like thunder half o'er the parish . "
23812	23836	23838	23839	the landlord	759	" Aye , but there 's more going on in the stables than what folks see by daylight , eh , Mr. Macey ? "
23841	23858	23860	23861	Mr. Macey	36	" Aye , aye ; go that way of a dark night , that 's all , "
23866	23915	23860	23861	Mr. Macey	36	" and then make believe , if you like , as you did n't see lights i ' the stables , nor hear the stamping o ' the hosses , nor the cracking o ' the whips , and howling , too , if it 's tow'rt daybreak . "
23919	23990	23860	23861	Mr. Macey	36	" has been the name of it ever sin ' I were a boy ; that 's to say , some said as it was the holiday Old Harry gev him from roasting , like . That 's what my father told me , and he was a reasonable man , though there 's folks nowadays know what happened afore they were born better nor they know their own business . "
23991	24003	24005	24006	the landlord	759	" What do you say to that , eh , Dowlas ? "
24022	24034	24005	24006	the landlord	759	" There 's a nut for _ you _ to crack . "
24052	24170	24005	24006	the landlord	759	" Say ? I say what a man _ should _ say as does n't shut his eyes to look at a finger - post . I say , as I 'm ready to wager any man ten pound , if he 'll stand out wi ' me any dry night in the pasture before the Warren stables , as we shall neither see lights nor hear noises , if it is n't the blowing of our own noses . That 's what I say , and I 've said it many a time ; but there 's nobody ' ull ventur a ten - pun ' note on their ghos'es as they make so sure of . "
24171	24184	24186	24187	Ben Winthrop	83	" Why , Dowlas , that 's easy betting , that is , "
24189	24261	24186	24187	Ben Winthrop	83	" You might as well bet a man as he would n't catch the rheumatise if he stood up to 's neck in the pool of a frosty night . It ' ud be fine fun for a man to win his bet as he 'd catch the rheumatise . Folks as believe in Cliff 's Holiday are n't agoing to ventur near it for a matter o ' ten pound . "
24262	24274	24276	24277	Mr. Macey	36	" If Master Dowlas wants to know the truth on it , "
24289	24329	24276	24277	Mr. Macey	36	" he 's no call to lay any bet - let him go and stan ' by himself - there 's nobody ' ull hinder him ; and then he can let the parish'ners know if they 're wrong . "
24330	24340	24342	24343	the farrier	764	" Thank you ! I 'm obliged to you , "
24351	24439	24342	24343	the farrier	764	" If folks are fools , it 's no business o ' mine . _ I _ do n't want to make out the truth about ghos'es : I know it a'ready . But I 'm not against a bet - everything fair and open . Let any man bet me ten pound as I shall see Cliff 's Holiday , and I 'll go and stand by myself . I want no company . I 'd as lief do it as I 'd fill this pipe . "
24440	24464	24466	24467	the butcher	762	" Ah , but who 's to watch you , Dowlas , and see you do it ? That 's no fair bet , "
24469	24474	24476	24477	Mr. Dowlas	94	" No fair bet ? "
24481	24514	24476	24477	Mr. Dowlas	94	" I should like to hear any man stand up and say I want to bet unfair . Come now , Master Lundy , I should like to hear you say it . "
24515	24521	24523	24524	the butcher	762	" Very like you would , "
24526	24583	24523	24524	the butcher	762	" But it 's no business o ' mine . You 're none o ' my bargains , and I are n't a - going to try and ' bate your price . If anybody 'll bid for you at your own vallying , let him . I 'm for peace and quietness , I am . "
24584	24604	24606	24607	the farrier	764	" Yes , that 's what every yapping cur is , when you hold a stick up at him , "
24609	24642	24606	24607	the farrier	764	" But I 'm afraid o ' neither man nor ghost , and I 'm ready to lay a fair bet . _ I _ are n't a turn - tail cur . "
24643	24655	24657	24658	the landlord	759	" Aye , but there 's this in it , Dowlas , "
24670	24747	24657	24658	the landlord	759	" There 's folks , i ' my opinion , they ca n't see ghos'es , not if they stood as plain as a pike - staff before 'em . And there 's reason i ' that . For there 's my wife , now , ca n't smell , not if she 'd the strongest o ' cheese under her nose . I never see'd a ghost myself ; but then I says to myself , "
24759	24862	24750	24750	I	0	" I mean , putting a ghost for a smell , or else contrairiways . And so , I 'm for holding with both sides ; for , as I say , the truth lies between 'em . And if Dowlas was to go and stand , and say he 'd never seen a wink o ' Cliff 's Holiday all the night through , I 'd back him ; and if anybody said as Cliff 's Holiday was certain sure , for all that , I 'd back _ him _ too . For the smell 's what I go by . "
24883	24888	24889	24889	he	764	" Tut , tut , "
24900	24965	24889	24889	he	764	" what 's the smell got to do with it ? Did ever a ghost give a man a black eye ? That 's what I should like to know . If ghos'es want me to believe in 'em , let 'em leave off skulking i ' the dark and i ' lone places - let 'em come where there 's company and candles . "
24966	24982	24984	24985	Mr. Macey	36	" As if ghos'es ' ud want to be believed in by anybody so ignirant ! "
25275	25279	25280	25280	he	759	" Master Marner , "
25288	25301	25280	25280	he	759	" what 's lacking to you ? What 's your business here ? "
25302	25305	25307	25307	Silas	32	" Robbed ! "
25311	25334	25307	25307	Silas	32	" I 've been robbed ! I want the constable - and the Justice - and Squire Cass - and Mr. Crackenthorp . "
25335	25344	25346	25347	the landlord	759	" Lay hold on him , Jem Rodney , "
25356	25371	25346	25347	the landlord	759	" he 's off his head , I doubt . He 's wet through . "
25397	25415	25417	25417	Jem	34	" Come and lay hold on him yourself , Mr. Snell , if you 've a mind , "
25422	25437	25438	25438	he	34	" He 's been robbed , and murdered too , for what I know , "
25446	25450	25452	25452	Silas	32	" Jem Rodney ! "
25465	25479	25481	25481	Jem	34	" Aye , Master Marner , what do you want wi ' me ? "
25498	25507	25509	25509	Silas	32	" If it was you stole my money , "
25524	25565	25518	25518	his	32	" give it me back - and I wo n't meddle with you . I wo n't set the constable on you . Give it me back , and I 'll let you - I'll let you have a guinea . "
25566	25572	25574	25574	Jem	34	" Me stole your money ! "
25578	25599	25574	25574	Jem	34	" I 'll pitch this can at your eye if you talk o ' _ my _ stealing your money . "
25600	25608	25610	25611	the landlord	759	" Come , come , Master Marner , "
25624	25678	25610	25611	the landlord	759	" if you 've got any information to lay , speak it out sensible , and show as you 're in your right mind , if you expect anybody to listen to you . You 're as wet as a drownded rat . Sit down and dry yourself , and speak straight forrard . "
25679	25688	25690	25691	the farrier	764	" Ah , to be sure , man , "
25712	25752	25698	25698	he	764	" Let 's have no more staring and screaming , else we 'll have you strapped for a madman . That was why I did n't speak at the first - thinks I , the man 's run mad . "
25753	25763	25610	25611	the landlord	759	" Aye , aye , make him sit down , "
25877	25902	25868	25869	the landlord	759	" Now then , Master Marner , what 's this you 've got to say - as you 've been robbed ? Speak out . "
25903	25917	25919	25920	Jem Rodney	34	" He 'd better not say again as it was me robbed him , "
25924	25949	25919	25920	Jem Rodney	34	" What could I ha ' done with his money ? I could as easy steal the parson 's surplice , and wear it . "
25950	25968	25970	25971	the landlord	759	" Hold your tongue , Jem , and let 's hear what he 's got to say , "
25973	25980	25970	25971	the landlord	759	" Now then , Master Marner . "
26166	26182	26162	26163	Mr. Macey	36	" Folks as had the devil to back 'em were not likely to be so mushed "
26308	26323	26325	26326	the landlord	759	" It is n't Jem Rodney as has done this work , Master Marner , "
26328	26413	26325	26326	the landlord	759	" You must n't be a - casting your eye at poor Jem . There may be a bit of a reckoning against Jem for the matter of a hare or so , if anybody was bound to keep their eyes staring open , and niver to wink ; but Jem 's been a - sitting here drinking his can , like the decentest man i ' the parish , since before you left your house , Master Marner , by your own account . "
26414	26419	26421	26422	Mr. Macey	36	" Aye , aye , "
26424	26471	26421	26422	Mr. Macey	36	" let 's have no accusing o ' the innicent . That is n't the law . There must be folks to swear again ' a man before he can be ta'en up . Let 's have no accusing o ' the innicent , Master Marner . "
26538	26543	26544	26544	he	32	" I was wrong , "
26545	26599	26600	26600	he	32	said-"yes , yes - I ought to have thought . There 's nothing to witness against you , Jem . Only you 'd been into my house oftener than anybody else , and so you came into my head . I do n't accuse you - I wo n't accuse anybody - only , "
26618	26632	26600	26600	he	32	" I try - I try to think where my guineas can be . "
26633	26653	26655	26656	Mr. Macey	36	" Aye , aye , they 're gone where it 's hot enough to melt 'em , I doubt , "
26658	26661	26663	26664	the farrier	764	" Tchuh ! "
26678	26692	26668	26668	he	764	" How much money might there be in the bags , Master Marner ? "
26693	26713	26715	26715	Silas	32	" Two hundred and seventy - two pounds , twelve and sixpence , last night when I counted it , "
26725	26973	26668	26668	he	764	" Pooh ! why , they 'd be none so heavy to carry . Some tramp 's been in , that 's all ; and as for the no footmarks , and the bricks and the sand being all right - why , your eyes are pretty much like a insect 's , Master Marner ; they 're obliged to look so close , you ca n't see much at a time . It 's my opinion as , if I 'd been you , or you 'd been me - for it comes to the same thing - you would n't have thought you 'd found everything as you left it . But what I vote is , as two of the sensiblest o ' the company should go with you to Master Kench , the constable's - he 's ill i ' bed , I know that much - and get him to appoint one of us his deppity ; for that 's the law , and I do n't think anybody ' ull take upon him to contradick me there . It is n't much of a walk to Kench 's ; and then , if it 's me as is deppity , I 'll go back with you , Master Marner , and examine your premises ; and if anybody 's got any fault to find with that , I 'll thank him to stand up and say it out like a man . "
27005	27016	27018	27019	the landlord	759	" Let us see how the night is , though , "
27031	27039	27040	27040	he	759	" Why , it rains heavy still , "
27048	27064	27066	27067	the farrier	764	" Well , I 'm not the man to be afraid o ' the rain , "

29803	29890	29801	29801	Bryce	69	" You see , I 'd made a bargain with him to buy the horse for a hundred and twenty - a swinging price , but I always liked the horse . And what does he do but go and stake him - fly at a hedge with stakes in it , atop of a bank with a ditch before it . The horse had been dead a pretty good while when he was found . So he has n't been home since , has he ? "
29891	29896	29898	29898	Godfrey	61	" Home ? no , "

29940	30018	29938	29938	Bryce	69	" after I 'd bargained for the horse , it did come into my head that he might be riding and selling the horse without your knowledge , for I did n't believe it was his own . I knew Master Dunsey was up to his tricks sometimes . But where can he be gone ? He 's never been seen at Batherley . He could n't have been hurt , for he must have walked off . "

30065	30089	30091	30091	Godfrey	61	" Yes ; I wanted to part with the horse - he was always a little too hard in the mouth for me , "

I suppose Master Dunsey did n't like to show himself till the ill news had blown over a bit . He 's perhaps gone to pay a visit at the Three Crowns , by Whitbridge - I know he 's fond of the house .

32015	32022	32024	32025	the Squire	528	" What ! broke his knees ? "
32034	32234	32024	32025	the Squire	528	" I thought you knew how to ride better than that , sir . I never threw a horse down in my life . If I had , I might ha ' whistled for another , for _ my _ father was n't quite so ready to unstring as some other fathers I know of . But they must turn over a new leaf-_they _ must . What with mortgages and arrears , I 'm as short o ' cash as a roadside pauper . And that fool Kimble says the newspaper 's talking about peace . Why , the country would n't have a leg to stand on . Prices ' ud run down like a jack , and I should never get my arrears , not if I sold all the fellows up . And there 's that damned Fowler , I wo n't put up with him any longer ; I 've told Winthrop to go to Cox this very day . The lying scoundrel told me he 'd be sure to pay me a hundred last month . He takes advantage because he 's on that outlying farm , and thinks I shall forget him . "
32336	32354	32355	32355	he	61	" It 's worse than breaking the horse 's knees - he 's been staked and killed , "
32374	32485	32355	32355	he	61	" But I was n't thinking of asking you to buy me another horse ; I was only thinking I 'd lost the means of paying you with the price of Wildfire , as I 'd meant to do . Dunsey took him to the hunt to sell him for me the other day , and after he 'd made a bargain for a hundred and twenty with Bryce , he went after the hounds , and took some fool 's leap or other that did for the horse at once . If it had n't been for that , I should have paid you a hundred pounds this morning . "
32545	32562	32564	32564	Godfrey	61	" The truth is , sir - I'm very sorry - I was quite to blame , "
32566	32619	32564	32564	Godfrey	61	" Fowler did pay that hundred pounds . He paid it to me , when I was over there one day last month . And Dunsey bothered me for the money , and I let him have it , because I hoped I should be able to pay it you before this . "
32638	32766	32620	32621	The Squire	528	" You let Dunsey have it , sir ? And how long have you been so thick with Dunsey that you must _ collogue _ with him to embezzle my money ? Are you turning out a scamp ? I tell you I wo n't have it . I 'll turn the whole pack of you out of the house together , and marry again . I 'd have you to remember , sir , my property 's got no entail on it;-since my grandfather 's time the Casses can do as they like with their land . Remember that , sir . Let Dunsey have the money ! Why should you let Dunsey have the money ? There 's some lie at the bottom of it . "
32767	32775	32777	32777	Godfrey	61	" There 's no lie , sir , "
32779	32853	32777	32777	Godfrey	61	" I would n't have spent the money myself , but Dunsey bothered me , and I was a fool , and let him have it . But I meant to pay it , whether he did or not . That 's the whole story . I never meant to embezzle money , and I 'm not the man to do it . You never knew me do a dishonest trick , sir . "
32854	32933	32620	32621	The Squire	528	" Where 's Dunsey , then ? What do you stand talking there for ? Go and fetch Dunsey , as I tell you , and let him give account of what he wanted the money for , and what he 's done with it . He shall repent it . I 'll turn him out . I said I would , and I 'll do it . He sha n't brave me . Go and fetch him . "
32934	32943	32777	32777	Godfrey	61	" Dunsey is n't come back , sir . "
32944	32956	32958	32959	the Squire	528	" What ! did he break his own neck , then ? "
32980	33026	32777	32777	Godfrey	61	" No , he was n't hurt , I believe , for the horse was found dead , and Dunsey must have walked off . I daresay we shall see him again by - and - by . I do n't know where he is . "
33027	33044	33046	33047	the Squire	528	" And what must you be letting him have my money for ? Answer me that , "
33060	33070	33072	33072	Godfrey	61	" Well , sir , I do n't know , "
33119	33152	33154	33155	the Squire	528	" You do n't know ? I tell you what it is , sir . You 've been up to some trick , and you 've been bribing him not to tell , "
33204	33209	33210	33210	he	61	" Why , sir , "
33220	33284	33210	33210	he	61	" it was a little affair between me and Dunsey ; it 's no matter to anybody else . It 's hardly worth while to pry into young men 's fooleries : it would n't have made any difference to you , sir , if I 'd not had the bad luck to lose Wildfire . I should have paid you the money . "
33285	33318	33320	33321	the Squire	528	" Fooleries ! Pshaw ! it 's time you 'd done with fooleries . And I 'd have you know , sir , you _ must _ ha ' done with 'em , "
33333	33431	33320	33321	the Squire	528	" Your goings - on are not what I shall find money for any longer . There 's my grandfather had his stables full o ' horses , and kept a good house , too , and in worse times , by what I can make out ; and so might I , if I had n't four good - for - nothing fellows to hang on me like horse - leeches . I 've been too good a father to you all - that 's what it is . But I shall pull up , sir . "
33518	33541	34114	34115	the Squire	528	" It 'll be all the worse for you , you know - you'd need try and help me keep things together . "
33542	33582	33601	33613	the Squire , whose memory consisted in certain strong impressions unmodified by detail	1051	" Well , sir , I 've often offered to take the management of things , but you know you 've taken it ill always , and seemed to think I wanted to push you out of your place . "
33583	33599	34114	34115	the Squire	528	" I know nothing o ' your offering or o ' my taking it ill , "
33615	33779	34114	34115	the Squire	528	" but I know , one while you seemed to be thinking o ' marrying , and I did n't offer to put any obstacles in your way , as some fathers would . I 'd as lieve you married Lammeter 's daughter as anybody . I suppose , if I 'd said you nay , you 'd ha ' kept on with it ; but , for want o ' contradiction , you 've changed your mind . You 're a shilly - shally fellow : you take after your poor mother . She never had a will of her own ; a woman has no call for one , if she 's got a proper man for her husband . But _ your _ wife had need have one , for you hardly know your own mind enough to make both your legs walk one way . The lass has n't said downright she wo n't have you , has she ? "
33780	33783	33785	33785	Godfrey	61	" No , "
33793	33802	33785	33785	Godfrey	61	" but I do n't think she will . "
33803	33832	34114	34115	the Squire	528	" Think ! why have n't you the courage to ask her ? Do you stick to it , you want to have _ her_-that 's the thing ? "
33833	33844	33846	33846	Godfrey	61	" There 's no other woman I want to marry , "
33850	33932	34114	34115	the Squire	528	" Well , then , let me make the offer for you , that 's all , if you have n't the pluck to do it yourself . Lammeter is n't likely to be loath for his daughter to marry into _ my _ family , I should think . And as for the pretty lass , she would n't have her cousin - and there 's nobody else , as I see , could ha ' stood in your way . "
33933	33947	33949	33949	Godfrey	61	" I 'd rather let it be , please sir , at present , "
33954	33985	33949	33949	Godfrey	61	" I think she 's a little offended with me just now , and I should like to speak for myself . A man must manage these things for himself . "
33986	34023	34114	34115	the Squire	528	" Well , speak , then , and manage it , and see if you ca n't turn over a new leaf . That 's what a man must do when he thinks o ' marrying . "
34024	34089	33949	33949	Godfrey	61	" I do n't see how I can think of it at present , sir . You would n't like to settle me on one of the farms , I suppose , and I do n't think she 'd come to live in this house with all my brothers . It 's a different sort of life to what she 's been used to . "
34090	34112	34114	34115	the Squire	528	" Not come to live in this house ? Do n't tell me . You ask her , that 's all , "
34124	34138	34140	34140	Godfrey	61	" I 'd rather let the thing be , at present , sir , "
34142	34157	34140	34140	Godfrey	61	" I hope you wo n't try to hurry it on by saying anything . "
34158	34166	34168	34169	the Squire	528	" I shall do what I choose , "
34171	34304	34168	34169	the Squire	528	" and I shall let you know I 'm master ; else you may turn out and find an estate to drop into somewhere else . Go out and tell Winthrop not to go to Cox 's , but wait for me . And tell 'em to get my horse saddled . And stop : look out and get that hack o ' Dunsey 's sold , and hand me the money , will you ? He 'll keep no more hacks at my expense . And if you know where he 's sneaking - I daresay you do - you may tell him to spare himself the journey o ' coming back home . Let him turn ostler , and keep himself . He sha n't hang on me any more . "
34305	34333	34335	34335	Godfrey	61	" I do n't know where he is , sir ; and if I did , it is n't my place to tell him to keep away , "

36149	36186	36140	36140	they	1106	" Well , Master Marner , you 're no worse off nor other poor folks , after all ; and if you was to be crippled , the parish ' ud give you a ' lowance . "
36344	36837	36336	36336	he	32	" Come , Master Marner , why , you 've no call to sit a - moaning . You 're a deal better off to ha ' lost your money , nor to ha ' kep it by foul means . I used to think , when you first come into these parts , as you were no better nor you should be ; you were younger a deal than what you are now ; but you were allays a staring , white - faced creatur , partly like a bald - faced calf , as I may say . But there 's no knowing : it is n't every queer - looksed thing as Old Harry 's had the making of - I mean , speaking o ' toads and such ; for they 're often harmless , like , and useful against varmin . And it 's pretty much the same wi ' you , as fur as I can see . Though as to the yarbs and stuff to cure the breathing , if you brought that sort o ' knowledge from distant parts , you might ha ' been a bit freer of it . And if the knowledge was n't well come by , why , you might ha ' made up for it by coming to church reg'lar ; for , as for the children as the Wise Woman charmed , I 've been at the christening of 'em again and again , and they took the water just as well . And that 's reasonable ; for if Old Harry 's a mind to do a bit o ' kindness for a holiday , like , who 's got anything against it ? That 's my thinking ; and I 've been clerk o ' this parish forty year , and I know , when the parson and me does the cussing of a Ash Wednesday , there 's no cussing o ' folks as have a mind to be cured without a doctor , let Kimble say what he will . And so , Master Marner , as I was saying - for there 's windings i ' things as they may carry you to the fur end o ' the prayer - book afore you get back to 'em - my advice is , as you keep up your sperrits ; for as for thinking you 're a deep un , and ha ' got more inside you nor ' ull bear daylight , I 'm not o ' that opinion at all , and so I tell the neighbours . For , says I , you talk o ' Master Marner making out a tale - why , it 's nonsense , that is : it ' ud take a ' cute man to make a tale like that ; and , says I , he looked as scared as a rabbit . "
36941	36956	36958	36959	Mr. Macey	36	" Come , Master Marner , have you got nothing to say to that ? "

37016	37029	37013	37014	Mr. Macey	36	" and my advice is - have you got a Sunday suit ? "
37030	37033	37035	37035	Marner	32	" No , "
37037	37044	37046	37047	Mr. Macey	36	" I doubted it was so , "
37049	37127	37046	37047	Mr. Macey	36	" Now , let me advise you to get a Sunday suit : there 's Tookey , he 's a poor creatur , but he 's got my tailoring business , and some o ' my money in it , and he shall make a suit at a low price , and give you trust , and then you can come to church , and be a bit neighbourly . Why , you 've never heared me say "
37129	37179	37181	37182	Mr. Macey	36	" since you come into these parts , and I recommend you to lose no time , for it 'll be poor work when Tookey has it all to himself , for I may n't be equil to stand i ' the desk at all , come another winter . "
37204	37274	37200	37200	he	36	" And as for the money for the suit o ' clothes , why , you get a matter of a pound a - week at your weaving , Master Marner , and you 're a young man , eh , for all you look so mushed . Why , you could n't ha ' been five - and - twenty when you come into these parts , eh ? "

38416	38471	38414	38414	Dolly	109	" I ca n't read 'em myself , and there 's nobody , not Mr. Macey himself , rightly knows what they mean ; but they 've a good meaning , for they 're the same as is on the pulpit - cloth at church . What are they , Aaron , my dear ? "
38479	38488	38490	38491	his mother	300	" Oh , go , that 's naughty , "
38495	38569	38490	38491	his mother	300	" Well , whativer the letters are , they 've a good meaning ; and it 's a stamp as has been in our house , Ben says , ever since he was a little un , and his mother used to put it on the cakes , and I 've allays put it on too ; for if there 's any good , we 've need of it i ' this world . "
38570	38577	38579	38579	Silas	32	" It 's I. H. S. , "
38593	38606	38608	38608	Dolly	109	" Well , to be sure , you can read 'em off , "
38610	38746	38608	38608	Dolly	109	" Ben 's read 'em to me many and many a time , but they slip out o ' my mind again ; the more 's the pity , for they 're good letters , else they would n't be in the church ; and so I prick 'em on all the loaves and all the cakes , though sometimes they wo n't hold , because o ' the rising - for , as I said , if there 's any good to be got we 've need of it i ' this world - that we have ; and I hope they 'll bring good to you , Master Marner , for it 's wi ' that will I brought you the cakes ; and you see the letters have held better nor common . "
38786	38793	38779	38779	He	32	before-"Thank you - thank you kindly . "
38830	38845	38847	38847	Dolly	109	" Ah , if there 's good anywhere , we 've need of it , "
38868	38933	38858	38858	She	109	" But you did n't hear the church - bells this morning , Master Marner ? I doubt you did n't know it was Sunday . Living so lone here , you lose your count , I daresay ; and then , when your loom makes a noise , you ca n't hear the bells , more partic'lar now the frost kills the sound . "
38934	38944	38946	38946	Silas	32	" Yes , I did ; I heard 'em , "
38976	38980	38982	38982	Dolly	109	" Dear heart ! "
38990	39224	38986	38986	she	109	" But what a pity it is you should work of a Sunday , and not clean yourself - if you _ did n't _ go to church ; for if you 'd a roasting bit , it might be as you could n't leave it , being a lone man . But there 's the bakehus , if you could make up your mind to spend a twopence on the oven now and then,-not every week , in course - I should n't like to do that myself,-you might carry your bit o ' dinner there , for it 's nothing but right to have a bit o ' summat hot of a Sunday , and not to make it as you ca n't know your dinner from Saturday . But now , upo ' Christmas - day , this blessed Christmas as is ever coming , if you was to take your dinner to the bakehus , and go to church , and see the holly and the yew , and hear the anthim , and then take the sacramen ' , you 'd be a deal the better , and you 'd know which end you stood on , and you could put your trust i ' Them as knows better nor we do , seein ' you 'd ha ' done what it lies on us all to do . "
39319	39324	39325	39325	he	32	" Nay , nay , "
39328	39343	39325	39325	he	32	" I know nothing o ' church . I 've never been to church . "
39344	39347	39349	39349	Dolly	109	" No ! "
39373	39389	39370	39370	she	109	" Could it ha ' been as they 'd no church where you was born ? "
39390	39395	39397	39397	Silas	32	" Oh , yes , "
39417	39443	39397	39397	Silas	32	" There was churches - a many - it was a big town . But I knew nothing of 'em - I went to chapel . "

39480	39656	39478	39478	she	109	" Well , Master Marner , it 's niver too late to turn over a new leaf , and if you 've niver had no church , there 's no telling the good it 'll do you . For I feel so set up and comfortable as niver was , when I 've been and heard the prayers , and the singing to the praise and glory o ' God , as Mr. Macey gives out - and Mr. Crackenthorp saying good words , and more partic'lar on Sacramen ' Day ; and if a bit o ' trouble comes , I feel as I can put up wi ' it , for I 've looked for help i ' the right quarter , and gev myself up to Them as we must all give ourselves up to at the last ; and if we'n done our part , it is n't to be believed as Them as are above us ' ull be worse nor we are , and come short o ' Their'n . "

39904	39921	39922	39922	she	300	" why , you do n't want cake again yet awhile . He 's wonderful hearty , "
39929	39965	39922	39922	she	300	sigh-"that he is , God knows . He 's my youngest , and we spoil him sadly , for either me or the father must allays hev him in our sight - that we must . "

40112	40119	40121	40121	Dolly	111	" Oh , that 's naughty , "
40125	40146	40121	40121	Dolly	111	" Stan ' up , when mother tells you , and let me hold the cake till you 've done . "

The boy sings pretty , do n't he , Master Marner ? "
40470	40473	40475	40475	Silas	32	" Yes , "
40479	40483	40475	40475	Silas	32	" very pretty . "
40547	40558	40560	40560	Dolly	111	" Oh , no , thank you , Master Marner , "
40569	40721	40560	40560	Dolly	111	" We must be going home now . And so I wish you good - bye , Master Marner ; and if you ever feel anyways bad in your inside , as you ca n't fend for yourself , I 'll come and clean up for you , and get you a bit o ' victual , and willing . But I beg and pray of you to leave off weaving of a Sunday , for it 's bad for soul and body - and the money as comes i ' that way ' ull be a bad bed to lie down on at the last , if it does n't fly away , nobody knows where , like the white frost . And you 'll excuse me being that free with you , Master Marner , for I wish you well - I do . Make your bow , Aaron . "

41679	41705	41677	41677	Godfrey	61	" and I shall sit by Nancy then , and dance with her , and get a kind look from her in spite of herself . "

41749	41779	41677	41677	Godfrey	61	" Well , but something may happen to make things easier . At any rate , there 's one pleasure for me close at hand : Nancy is coming . "
41780	41808	41717	41717	Anxiety	116	" Yes , and suppose your father should bring matters to a pass that will oblige you to decline marrying her - and to give your reasons ? "
41809	41843	41677	41677	Godfrey	61	" Hold your tongue , and do n't worry me . I can see Nancy 's eyes , just as they will look at me , and feel her hand in mine already . "

44256	44370	44371	44371	Priscilla	74	" I 'm obliged to have the same as Nancy , you know , for all I 'm five years older , and it makes me look yallow ; for she never _ will _ have anything without I have mine just like it , because she wants us to look like sisters . And I tell her , folks ' ull think it 's my weakness makes me fancy as I shall look pretty in what she looks pretty in . For I _ am _ ugly - there 's no denying that : I feature my father 's family . But , law ! I do n't mind , do you ? "
44400	44648	44375	44377	the Miss Gunns	119	" The pretty uns do for fly - catchers - they keep the men off us . I 've no opinion o ' the men , Miss Gunn - I do n't know what _ you _ have . And as for fretting and stewing about what _ they_'ll think of you from morning till night , and making your life uneasy about what they 're doing when they 're out o ' your sight - as I tell Nancy , it 's a folly no woman need be guilty of , if she 's got a good father and a good home : let her leave it to them as have got no fortin , and ca n't help themselves . As I say , Mr. Have - your - own - way is the best husband , and the only one I 'd ever promise to obey . I know it is n't pleasant , when you 've been used to living in a big way , and managing hogsheads and all that , to go and put your nose in by somebody else 's fireside , or to sit down by yourself to a scrag or a knuckle ; but , thank God ! my father 's a sober man and likely to live ; and if you 've got a man by the chimney - corner , it does n't matter if he 's childish - the business need n't be broke up . "
44689	44708	44680	44681	Mrs. Osgood	48	" Well , niece , you 'll follow us . The Miss Gunns will like to go down . "
44709	44712	44714	44714	Nancy	62	" Sister , "
44721	44733	44714	44714	Nancy	62	" you 've offended the Miss Gunns , I 'm sure . "
44734	44742	44744	44744	Priscilla	74	" What have I done , child ? "
44750	44768	44714	44714	Nancy	62	" Why , you asked them if they minded about being ugly - you're so very blunt . "
44769	44857	44714	44714	Nancy	62	" Law , did I ? Well , it popped out : it 's a mercy I said no more , for I 'm a bad un to live with folks when they do n't like the truth . But as for being ugly , look at me , child , in this silver - coloured silk - I told you how it ' ud be - I look as yallow as a daffadil . Anybody ' ud say you wanted to make a mawkin of me . "
44858	44903	44905	44905	Nancy	62	" No , Priscy , do n't say so . I begged and prayed of you not to let us have this silk if you 'd like another better . I was willing to have _ your _ choice , you know I was , "
44913	45040	44714	44714	Nancy	62	" Nonsense , child ! you know you 'd set your heart on this ; and reason good , for you 're the colour o ' cream . It ' ud be fine doings for you to dress yourself to suit _ my _ skin . What I find fault with , is that notion o ' yours as I must dress myself just like you . But you do as you like with me - you always did , from when first you begun to walk . If you wanted to go the field 's length , the field 's length you 'd go ; and there was no whipping you , for you looked as prim and innicent as a daisy all the while . "
45041	45044	45046	45046	Nancy	62	" Priscy , "
45077	45171	45051	45051	she	62	" I 'm sure I 'm willing to give way as far as is right , but who should n't dress alike if it is n't sisters ? Would you have us go about looking as if we were no kin to one another - us that have got no mother and not another sister in the world ? I 'd do what was right , if I dressed in a gown dyed with cheese - colouring ; and I 'd rather you 'd choose , and let me wear what pleases you . "
45172	45235	45051	45051	she	62	" There you go again ! You 'd come round to the same thing if one talked to you from Saturday night till Saturday morning . It 'll be fine fun to see how you 'll master your husband and never raise your voice above the singing o ' the kettle all the while . I like to see the men mastered ! "
45236	45246	45248	45248	Nancy	62	" Do n't talk _ so _ , Priscy , "
45252	45264	45248	45248	Nancy	62	" You know I do n't mean ever to be married . "
45265	45276	45281	45281	she	74	" Oh , you never mean a fiddlestick 's end ! "
45292	45434	45281	45281	she	74	" Who shall _ I _ have to work for when father 's gone , if you are to go and take notions in your head and be an old maid , because some folks are no better than they should be ? I have n't a bit o ' patience with you - sitting on an addled egg for ever , as if there was never a fresh un in the world . One old maid 's enough out o ' two sisters ; and I shall do credit to a single life , for God A'mighty meant me for it . Come , we can go down now . I 'm as ready as a mawkin _ can _ be - there 's nothing awanting to frighten the crows , now I 've got my ear - droppers in . "

47090	47109	47111	47112	the Squire	528	" Not as your doctoring does , eh , Kimble?-because folks forget to take your physic , eh ? "
47168	47182	47184	47185	the doctor	215	" Ah , she has a quick wit , my friend Priscilla has , "
47209	47292	47184	47185	the doctor	215	" She saves a little pepper to sprinkle over her talk - that 's the reason why she never puts too much into her pies . There 's my wife now , she never has an answer at her tongue 's end ; but if I offend her , she 's sure to scarify my throat with black pepper the next day , or else give me the colic with watery greens . That 's an awful tit - for - tat . "
47302	47310	47312	47313	Mrs. Kimble	118	" Did you ever hear the like ? "
47359	47388	47390	47391	the rector	916	" I suppose that 's the sort of tit - for - tat adopted in your profession , Kimble , if you 've a grudge against a patient , "

47408	47436	47437	47437	he	114	" except when they leave us : and then , you see , we have n't the chance of prescribing for 'em . Ha , Miss Nancy , "
47447	47467	47437	47437	he	114	" you wo n't forget your promise ? You 're to save a dance for me , you know . "

47487	47540	47541	47541	he	528	" Give the young uns fair - play . There 's my son Godfrey'll be wanting to have a round with you if you run off with Miss Nancy . He 's bespoke her for the first dance , I 'll be bound . Eh , sir ! what do you say ? "
47553	47567	47541	47541	he	528	" Have n't you asked Miss Nancy to open the dance with you ? "

48349	48393	48335	48335	lad	1380	" There 's a many tunes I do n't make head or tail of ; but that speaks to me like the blackbird 's whistle . I suppose it 's the name : there 's a deal in the name of a tune . "
48410	48415	48395	48395	Solomon	86	" Sir Roger de Coverley "
48432	48445	48447	48448	the Squire	528	" Aye , aye , Solomon , we know what that means , "
48452	48476	48447	48448	the Squire	528	" It 's time to begin the dance , eh ? Lead the way , then , and we 'll all follow you . "
49092	49103	49105	49106	Mr. Macey	36	" The Squire 's pretty springe , considering his weight , "
49108	49225	49105	49106	Mr. Macey	36	" and he stamps uncommon well . But Mr. Lammeter beats 'em all for shapes : you see he holds his head like a sodger , and he is n't so cushiony as most o ' the oldish gentlefolks - they run fat in general ; and he 's got a fine leg . The parson 's nimble enough , but he has n't got much of a leg : it 's a bit too thick down'ard , and his knees might be a bit nearer wi'out damage ; but he might do worse , he might do worse . Though he has n't that grand way o ' waving his hand as the Squire has . "
49226	49237	49239	49240	Ben Winthrop	83	" Talk o ' nimbleness , look at Mrs. Osgood , "
49252	49312	49239	49240	Ben Winthrop	83	" She trips along with her little steps , so as nobody can see how she goes - it 's like as if she had little wheels to her feet . She does n't look a day older nor last year : she 's the finest - made woman as is , let the next be where she will . "
49313	49324	49326	49327	Mr. Macey	36	" I do n't heed how the women are made , "
49333	49352	49326	49327	Mr. Macey	36	" They wear nayther coat nor breeches : you ca n't make much out o ' their shapes . "
49353	49356	49358	49358	Aaron	84	" Fayder , "
49369	49399	49358	49358	Aaron	84	" how does that big cock's - feather stick in Mrs. Crackenthorp 's yead ? Is there a little hole for it , like in my shuttle - cock ? "
49400	49419	49421	49422	the father	2237	" Hush , lad , hush ; that 's the way the ladies dress theirselves , that is , "
49435	49554	49421	49422	the father	2237	" It does make her look funny , though - partly like a short - necked bottle wi ' a long quill in it . Hey , by jingo , there 's the young Squire leading off now , wi ' Miss Nancy for partners ! There 's a lass for you!-like a pink - and - white posy - there 's nobody ' ud think as anybody could be so pritty . I should n't wonder if she 's Madam Cass some day , arter all - and nobody more rightfuller , for they 'd make a fine match . You can find nothing against Master Godfrey 's shapes , Macey , _ I_'ll bet a penny . "
49595	49636	49559	49559	his	36	" Pretty well down'ard , but a bit too round i ' the shoulder - blades . And as for them coats as he gets from the Flitton tailor , they 're a poor cut to pay double money for . "
49637	49650	49652	49652	Ben	83	" Ah , Mr. Macey , you and me are two folks , "
49660	49745	49652	49652	Ben	83	" When I 've got a pot o ' good ale , I like to swaller it , and do my inside good , i'stead o ' smelling and staring at it to see if I ca n't find faut wi ' the brewing . I should like you to pick me out a finer - limbed young fellow nor Master Godfrey - one as ' ud knock you down easier , or 's more pleasanter - looksed when he 's piert and merry . "
49746	49749	49751	49752	Mr. Macey	36	" Tchuh ! "
49759	49876	49751	49752	Mr. Macey	36	" he is n't come to his right colour yet : he 's partly like a slack - baked pie . And I doubt he 's got a soft place in his head , else why should he be turned round the finger by that offal Dunsey as nobody 's seen o ' late , and let him kill that fine hunting hoss as was the talk o ' the country ? And one while he was allays after Miss Nancy , and then it all went off again , like a smell o ' hot porridge , as I may say . That was n't my way when _ I _ went a - coorting . "
49877	49895	49897	49897	Ben	83	" Ah , but mayhap Miss Nancy hung off , like , and your lass did n't , "
49899	49907	49909	49910	Mr. Macey	36	" I should say she did n't , "
49914	49918	49909	49910	Mr. Macey	36	" Before I said "
49920	49931	49751	49752	Mr. Macey	36	" , I took care to know as she 'd say "
49933	49972	49751	49752	Mr. Macey	36	" , and pretty quick too . I was n't a - going to open _ my _ mouth , like a dog at a fly , and snap it to again , wi ' nothing to swaller . "
49973	49987	49989	49989	Ben	83	" Well , I think Miss Nancy 's a - coming round again , "
49991	50038	49989	49989	Ben	83	" for Master Godfrey does n't look so down - hearted to - night . And I see he 's for taking her away to sit down , now they 're at the end o ' the dance : that looks like sweethearting , that does . "
50304	50311	50313	50313	Nancy	62	" Oh no , thank you , "
50327	50360	50313	50313	Nancy	62	" not in there . I 'll wait here till Priscilla 's ready to come to me . I 'm sorry to bring you out of the dance and make myself troublesome . "
50361	50373	50375	50377	the artful Godfrey	61	" Why , you 'll be more comfortable here by yourself , "
50379	50391	50392	50392	He	61	" I 'll leave you here till your sister can come . "
50456	50462	50463	50463	she	62	" Thank you , sir , "
50467	50488	50463	50463	she	62	" I need n't give you any more trouble . I 'm sorry you 've had such an unlucky partner . "
50489	50499	50501	50501	Godfrey	61	" That 's very ill - natured of you , "
50513	50523	50501	50501	Godfrey	61	" to be sorry you 've danced with me . "
50524	50545	50547	50547	Nancy	62	" Oh , no , sir , I do n't mean to say what 's ill - natured at all , "
50555	50571	50547	50547	Nancy	62	" When gentlemen have so many pleasures , one dance can matter but very little . "
50572	50599	50501	50501	Godfrey	61	" You know that is n't true . You know one dance with you matters more to me than all the other pleasures in the world . "
50653	50692	50651	50651	she	62	" No , indeed , Mr. Godfrey , that 's not known to me , and I have very good reasons for thinking different . But if it 's true , I do n't wish to hear it . "
50693	50744	50651	50651	she	62	" Would you never forgive me , then , Nancy - never think well of me , let what would happen - would you never think the present made amends for the past ? Not if I turned a good fellow , and gave up everything you did n't like ? "
50814	50830	50831	50831	she	62	" I should be glad to see a good change in anybody , Mr. Godfrey , "
50842	50855	50831	50831	she	62	" but it ' ud be better if no change was wanted . "
50856	50866	50868	50868	Godfrey	61	" You 're very hard - hearted , Nancy , "
50872	50894	50868	50868	Godfrey	61	" You might encourage me to be a better fellow . I 'm very miserable - but you 've no feeling . "
50895	50910	50912	50912	Nancy	62	" I think those have the least feeling that act wrong to begin with , "
50975	50989	50968	50968	Priscilla	74	" Dear heart alive , child , let us look at this gown , "
50999	51007	51008	51008	he	61	" I suppose I must go now , "
51013	51026	51028	51030	that frank lady	1419	" It 's no matter to me whether you go or stay , "
51044	51054	51056	51056	Godfrey	61	" Do _ you _ want me to go ? "
51072	51077	51079	51079	Nancy	62	" As you like , "
51100	51107	51109	51109	Godfrey	61	" Then I like to stay , "

54600	54613	54614	54614	Silas	32	" I 'm come for the doctor - I want the doctor , "
54627	54637	54639	54640	the rector	916	" Why , what 's the matter , Marner ? "
54642	54657	54639	54640	the rector	916	" The doctor 's here ; but say quietly what you want him for . "
54658	54664	54666	54666	Silas	32	" It 's a woman , "
54682	54706	54678	54678	Godfrey	61	" She 's dead , I think - dead in the snow at the Stone - pits - not far from my door . "
54777	54782	54784	54785	Mr. Crackenthorp	82	" Hush , hush ! "
54787	54816	54817	54817	he	82	" Go out into the hall there . I 'll fetch the doctor to you . Found a woman in the snow - and thinks she 's dead , "
54826	54862	54817	54817	he	82	" Better say as little about it as possible : it will shock the ladies . Just tell them a poor woman is ill from cold and hunger . I 'll go and fetch Kimble . "
54955	54961	54963	54964	several ladies	1535	" What child is it ? "
54980	55001	55005	55005	Godfrey	61	" I do n't know - some poor woman 's who has been found in the snow , I believe , "

55041	55057	55059	55063	good - natured Mrs. Kimble	118	" Why , you 'd better leave the child here , then , Master Marner , "
55083	55096	55077	55077	her	1534	" I 'll tell one o ' the girls to fetch it . "
55097	55116	55118	55118	Silas	32	" No - no - I ca n't part with it , I ca n't let it go , "
55122	55136	55118	55118	Silas	32	" It 's come to me - I've a right to keep it . "
55184	55192	55194	55195	Mrs. Kimble	118	" Did you ever hear the like ? "
55205	55218	55220	55221	Mr. Kimble	114	" Now , ladies , I must trouble you to stand aside , "
55259	55273	55275	55276	the Squire	528	" It 's a nasty business turning out now , eh , Kimble ? "
55278	55300	55275	55276	the Squire	528	" He might ha ' gone for your young fellow - the ' prentice , there - what 's his name ? "
55301	55315	55317	55318	uncle Kimble	114	" Might ? aye - what 's the use of talking about might ? "
55333	55379	55331	55331	Godfrey	61	" Get me a pair of thick boots , Godfrey , will you ? And stay , let somebody run to Winthrop 's and fetch Dolly - she 's the best woman to get . Ben was here himself before supper ; is he gone ? "
55380	55389	55391	55391	Marner	32	" Yes , sir , I met him , "
55393	55458	55391	55391	Marner	32	" but I could n't stop to tell him anything , only I said I was going for the doctor , and he said the doctor was at the Squire 's . And I made haste and ran , and there was nobody to be seen at the back o ' the house , and so I went in to where the company was . "

55551	55560	55562	55563	uncle Kimble	114	" Oh , pooh - send somebody else , "
55570	55586	55588	55589	Mr. Crackenthorp	82	" You 'll let me know if I can be of any use , Kimble , "
55707	55718	55720	55720	Dolly	109	" You 'd a deal better go back , sir , "
55726	55810	55720	55720	Dolly	109	" You 've no call to catch cold ; and I 'd ask you if you 'd be so good as tell my husband to come , on your way back - he 's at the Rainbow , I doubt - if you found him anyway sober enough to be o ' use . Or else , there 's Mrs. Snell ' ud happen send the boy up to fetch and carry , for there may be things wanted from the doctor 's . "
55811	55829	55831	55831	Godfrey	61	" No , I 'll stay , now I 'm once out - I'll stay outside here , "
55841	55854	55831	55831	Godfrey	61	" You can come and tell me if I can do anything . "
55855	55871	55873	55873	Dolly	109	" Well , sir , you 're very good : you 've a tender heart , "

56205	56248	56161	56161	He	61	" Pooh , it was nonsense for you to come out : why did n't you send one of the men ? There 's nothing to be done . She 's dead - has been dead for hours , I should say . "
56249	56257	56259	56259	Godfrey	61	" What sort of woman is she ? "
56269	56317	56161	56161	He	61	" A young woman , but emaciated , with long black hair . Some vagrant - quite in rags . She 's got a wedding - ring on , however . They must fetch her away to the workhouse to - morrow . Come , come along . "
56318	56326	56328	56328	Godfrey	61	" I want to look at her , "
56330	56350	56328	56328	Godfrey	61	" I think I saw such a woman yesterday . I 'll overtake you in a minute or two . "
56639	56652	56654	56654	Godfrey	61	" You 'll take the child to the parish to - morrow ? "
56663	56668	56670	56670	Marner	32	" Who says so ? "
56674	56682	56670	56670	Marner	32	" Will they make me take her ? "
56683	56703	56654	56654	Godfrey	61	" Why , you would n't like to keep her , should you - an old bachelor like you ? "
56704	56719	56721	56721	Marner	32	" Till anybody shows they 've a right to take her away from me , "
56723	56781	56721	56721	Marner	32	" The mother 's dead , and I reckon it 's got no father : it 's a lone thing - and I 'm a lone thing . My money 's gone , I do n't know where - and this is come from I do n't know where . I know nothing - I'm partly mazed . "
56782	56787	56789	56789	Godfrey	61	" Poor little thing ! "
56791	56801	56789	56789	Godfrey	61	" Let me give something towards finding it clothes . "
56838	56852	56853	56853	he	61	" Ah , I see it 's not the same woman I saw , "
56861	56916	56853	56853	he	61	" It 's a pretty little child : the old fellow seems to want to keep it ; that 's strange for a miser like him . But I gave him a trifle to help him out : the parish is n't likely to quarrel with him for the right to keep the child . "
56917	57040	56857	56857	he	61	" No ; but I 've seen the time when I might have quarrelled with him for it myself . It 's too late now , though . If the child ran into the fire , your aunt 's too fat to overtake it : she could only sit and grunt like an alarmed sow . But what a fool you are , Godfrey , to come out in your dancing shoes and stockings in this way - and you one of the beaux of the evening , and at your own house ! What do you mean by such freaks , young fellow ? Has Miss Nancy been cruel , and do you want to spite her by spoiling your pumps ? "
57041	57081	57083	57083	Godfrey	61	" Oh , everything has been disagreeable to - night . I was tired to death of jigging and gallanting , and that bother about the hornpipes . And I 'd got to dance with the other Miss Gunn , "

The door was open , and it walked in over the snow , like as if it had been a little starved robin . Did n't you say the door was open ? "

We may strive and scrat and fend , but it 's little we can do arter all - the big things come and go wi ' no striving o ' our'n - they do , that they do ; and I think you 're in the right on it to keep the little un , Master Marner , seeing as it 's been sent to you , though there 's folks as thinks different . You 'll happen be a bit moithered with it while it 's so little ; but I 'll come , and welcome , and see to it for you : I 've a bit o ' time to spare most days , for when one gets up betimes i ' the morning , the clock seems to stan ' still tow'rt ten , afore it 's time to go about the victual . So , as I say , I 'll come and see to the child for you , and welcome . "

It 's lucky as you 've got that high hearth i'stead of a grate , for that keeps the fire more out of her reach : but if you 've got anything as can be spilt or broke , or as is fit to cut her fingers off , she 'll be at it - and it is but right you should know . "
58997	59010	59011	59011	he	32	" I 'll tie her to the leg o ' the loom , "
59014	59025	59011	59011	he	32	last-"tie her with a good long strip o ' something . "
59026	59221	59011	59011	he	32	" Well , mayhap that 'll do , as it 's a little gell , for they 're easier persuaded to sit i ' one place nor the lads . I know what the lads are ; for I 've had four - four I 've had , God knows - and if you was to take and tie 'em up , they 'd make a fighting and a crying as if you was ringing the pigs . But I 'll bring you my little chair , and some bits o ' red rag and things for her to play wi ' ; an ' she 'll sit and chatter to 'em as if they was alive . Eh , if it was n't a sin to the lads to wish 'em made different , bless 'em , I should ha ' been glad for one of 'em to be a little gell ; and to think as I could ha ' taught her to scour , and mend , and the knitting , and everything . But I can teach 'em this little un , Master Marner , when she gets old enough . "
59222	59233	59235	59235	Marner	32	" But she 'll be _ my _ little un , "
59240	59248	59235	59235	Marner	32	" She 'll be nobody else 's . "
59249	59280	59282	59282	Dolly	109	" No , to be sure ; you 'll have a right to her , if you 're a father to her , and bring her up according . But , "
59297	59331	59289	59289	she	109	" you must bring her up like christened folks 's children , and take her to church , and let her learn her catechise , as my little Aaron can say off - the "
59334	59340	59289	59289	she	109	" , and everything , and "
59346	59377	59289	59289	she	109	deed",-as well as if he was the clerk . That 's what you must do , Master Marner , if you 'd do the right thing by the orphin child . "
59412	59419	59420	59420	she	109	" And it 's my belief , "
59424	59558	59420	59420	she	109	" as the poor little creatur has never been christened , and it 's nothing but right as the parson should be spoke to ; and if you was noways unwilling , I 'd talk to Mr. Macey about it this very day . For if the child ever went anyways wrong , and you had n't done your part by it , Master Marner-'noculation , and everything to save it from harm - it ' ud be a thorn i ' your bed for ever o ' this side the grave ; and I ca n't think as it ' ud be easy lying down for anybody when they 'd got to another world , if they had n't done their part by the helpless children as come wi'out their own asking . "
59611	59613	59608	59608	Dolly	109	" christened "
59642	59650	59608	59608	Dolly	109	" What is it as you mean by "
59652	59654	59655	59655	he	32	" ? "
59662	59673	59655	59655	he	32	" Wo n't folks be good to her without it ? "
59674	59682	59684	59684	Dolly	109	" Dear , dear ! Master Marner , "
59692	59723	59684	59684	Dolly	109	" Had you never no father nor mother as taught you to say your prayers , and as there 's good words and good things to keep us from harm ? "
59724	59727	59729	59729	Silas	32	" Yes , "
59736	59764	59729	59729	Silas	32	" I know a deal about that - used to , used to . But your ways are different : my country was a good way off . "
59778	59824	59765	59765	He	32	" But I want to do everything as can be done for the child . And whatever 's right for it i ' this country , and you think ' ull do it good , I 'll act according , if you 'll tell me . "
59825	59833	59835	59835	Dolly	109	" Well , then , Master Marner , "
59840	59878	59835	59835	Dolly	109	" I 'll ask Mr. Macey to speak to the parson about it ; and you must fix on a name for it , because it must have a name giv ' it when it 's christened . "
59879	59887	59889	59889	Silas	32	" My mother 's name was Hephzibah , "
59891	59901	59889	59889	Silas	32	" and my little sister was named after her . "
59902	59911	59913	59913	Dolly	109	" Eh , that 's a hard name , "
59915	59926	59913	59913	Dolly	109	" I partly think it is n't a christened name . "
59927	59934	59936	59936	Silas	32	" It 's a Bible name , "
59942	59954	59956	59956	Dolly	109	" Then I 've no call to speak again ' it , "
59968	60051	59956	59956	Dolly	109	" but you see I 'm no scholard , and I 'm slow at catching the words . My husband says I 'm allays like as if I was putting the haft for the handle - that 's what he says - for he 's very sharp , God help him . But it was awk'ard calling your little sister by such a hard name , when you 'd got nothing big to say , like - wasn't it , Master Marner ? "
60052	60058	60060	60060	Silas	32	" We called her Eppie , "
60062	60231	59956	59956	Dolly	109	" Well , if it was noways wrong to shorten the name , it ' ud be a deal handier . And so I 'll go now , Master Marner , and I 'll speak about the christening afore dark ; and I wish you the best o ' luck , and it 's my belief as it 'll come to you , if you do what 's right by the orphin child;-and there 's the ' noculation to be seen to ; and as to washing its bits o ' things , you need look to nobody but me , for I can do 'em wi ' one hand when I 've got my suds about . Eh , the blessed angil ! You 'll let me bring my Aaron one o ' these days , and he 'll show her his little cart as his father 's made for him , and the black - and - white pup as he 's got a - rearing . "
60810	60815	60825	60825	she	144	" Dad - dad 's "
61036	61040	61086	61086	Silas	32	" Dad - dad "
61153	61169	61171	61171	Dolly	109	" To be sure , there 's another thing you might do , Master Marner , "
61175	61320	61171	61171	Dolly	109	" you might shut her up once i ' the coal - hole . That was what I did wi ' Aaron ; for I was that silly wi ' the youngest lad , as I could never bear to smack him . Not as I could find i ' my heart to let him stay i ' the coal - hole more nor a minute , but it was enough to colly him all over , so as he must be new washed and dressed , and it was as good as a rod to him - that was . But I put it upo ' your conscience , Master Marner , as there 's one of 'em you must choose - ayther smacking or the coal - hole - else she 'll get so masterful , there 'll be no holding her . "
61532	61535	61524	61524	Silas	32	" setting up "
61797	61800	61780	61780	Silas	32	" Eppie ! "
62153	62157	62147	62147	he	32	" make her remember "
62198	62204	62205	62205	he	32	" Naughty , naughty Eppie , "
62222	62254	62205	62205	he	32	clothes-"naughty to cut with the scissors and run away . Eppie must go into the coal - hole for being naughty . Daddy must put her in the coal - hole . "
62346	62351	62353	62353	Silas	32	" Opy , opy ! "
62361	62386	62353	62353	Silas	32	" Now Eppie ' ull never be naughty again , else she must go in the coal - hole - a black naughty place . "
62530	62538	62515	62515	she	144	" Eppie in de toal - hole ! "
62558	62567	62568	62568	he	32	" She 'd take it all for fun , "
62573	62620	62568	62568	he	32	" if I did n't hurt her , and that I ca n't do , Mrs. Winthrop . If she makes me a bit o ' trouble , I can bear it . And she 's got no tricks but what she 'll grow out of . "
62621	62632	62634	62634	Dolly	109	" Well , that 's partly true , Master Marner , "
62638	62745	62634	62634	Dolly	109	" and if you ca n't bring your mind to frighten her off touching things , you must do what you can to keep 'em out of her way . That 's what I do wi ' the pups as the lads are allays a - rearing . They _ will _ worry and gnaw - worry and gnaw they will , if it was one 's Sunday cap as hung anywhere so as they could drag it . They know no difference , God help 'em : it 's the pushing o ' the teeth as sets 'em on , that 's what it is . "
63017	63034	62996	62996	he	32	" Ah , Master Marner , you 'll be lucky if she takes the measles soon and easy!"-or
63036	63093	62996	62996	he	32	" Why , there is n't many lone men ' ud ha ' been wishing to take up with a little un like that : but I reckon the weaving makes you handier than men as do out - door work - you're partly as handy as a woman , for weaving comes next to spinning . "
63941	63946	63929	63929	their	388	" out of the country "
64067	64069	64062	64073	a lover who could say " yes " , if he liked	1706	" yes "

65087	65110	65112	65112	Eppie	144	" I wish _ we _ had a little garden , father , with double daisies in , like Mrs. Winthrop 's , "
65122	65173	65112	65112	Eppie	144	" only they say it ' ud take a deal of digging and bringing fresh soil - and you could n't do that , could you , father ? Anyhow , I should n't like you to do it , for it ' ud be too hard work for you . "
65174	65265	65281	65303	the young man in fustian , who was now by Eppie 's side , entering into the conversation without the trouble of formalities	1752	" Yes , I could do it , child , if you want a bit o ' garden : these long evenings , I could work at taking in a little bit o ' the waste , just enough for a root or two o ' flowers for you ; and again , i ' the morning , I could have a turn wi ' the spade before I sat down to the loom . Why did n't you tell me before as you wanted a bit o ' garden ? "
65266	65279	65281	65303	the young man in fustian , who was now by Eppie 's side , entering into the conversation without the trouble of formalities	1752	" _ I _ can dig it for you , Master Marner , "
65305	65354	65281	65303	the young man in fustian , who was now by Eppie 's side , entering into the conversation without the trouble of formalities	1752	" It 'll be play to me after I 've done my day 's work , or any odd bits o ' time when the work 's slack . And I 'll bring you some soil from Mr. Cass 's garden - he'll let me , and willing . "
65355	65367	65369	65369	Silas	32	" Eh , Aaron , my lad , are you there ? "
65371	65423	65369	65369	Silas	32	" I was n't aware of you ; for when Eppie 's talking o ' things , I see nothing but what she 's a - saying . Well , if you could help me with the digging , we might get her a bit o ' garden all the sooner . "
65424	65434	65436	65436	Aaron	84	" Then , if you think well and good , "
65438	65480	65436	65436	Aaron	84	" I 'll come to the Stone - pits this afternoon , and we 'll settle what land 's to be taken in , and I 'll get up an hour earlier i ' the morning , and begin on it . "
65481	65500	65502	65502	Eppie	144	" But not if you do n't promise me not to work at the hard digging , father , "
65504	65516	65517	65517	she	144	" For I should n't ha ' said anything about it , "
65528	65542	65517	65517	she	144	" only Mrs. Winthrop said as Aaron ' ud be so good , and- "
65543	65556	65558	65558	Aaron	84	" And you might ha ' known it without mother telling you , "
65560	65604	65558	65558	Aaron	84	" And Master Marner knows too , I hope , as I 'm able and willing to do a turn o ' work for him , and he wo n't do me the unkindness to anyways take it out o ' my hands . "
65605	65624	65626	65626	Eppie	144	" There , now , father , you wo n't work in it till it 's all easy , "
65628	65721	65626	65626	Eppie	144	" and you and me can mark out the beds , and make holes and plant the roots . It 'll be a deal livelier at the Stone - pits when we 've got some flowers , for I always think the flowers can see us and know what we 're talking about . And I 'll have a bit o ' rosemary , and bergamot , and thyme , because they 're so sweet - smelling ; but there 's no lavender only in the gentlefolks ' gardens , I think . "
65722	65734	65736	65736	Aaron	84	" That 's no reason why you should n't have some , "
65738	65789	65736	65736	Aaron	84	" for I can bring you slips of anything ; I 'm forced to cut no end of 'em when I 'm gardening , and throw 'em away mostly . There 's a big bed o ' lavender at the Red House : the missis is very fond of it . "
65790	65793	65795	65795	Silas	32	" Well , "
65799	65869	65795	65795	Silas	32	" so as you do n't make free for us , or ask for anything as is worth much at the Red House : for Mr. Cass 's been so good to us , and built us up the new end o ' the cottage , and given us beds and things , as I could n't abide to be imposin ' for garden - stuff or anything else . "
65870	65881	65883	65883	Aaron	84	" No , no , there 's no imposin ' , "
65885	65988	65883	65883	Aaron	84	" there 's never a garden in all the parish but what there 's endless waste in it for want o ' somebody as could use everything up . It 's what I think to myself sometimes , as there need nobody run short o ' victuals if the land was made the most on , and there was never a morsel but what could find its way to a mouth . It sets one thinking o ' that - gardening does . But I must go back now , else mother ' ull be in trouble as I are n't there . "
65989	65999	66001	66001	Eppie	144	" Bring her with you this afternoon , Aaron , "
66003	66030	66001	66001	Eppie	144	" I should n't like to fix about the garden , and her not know everything from the first - should _ you _ , father ? "
66031	66042	66044	66044	Silas	32	" Aye , bring her if you can , Aaron , "
66046	66067	66044	66044	Silas	32	" she 's sure to have a word to say as'll help us to set things on their right end . "
66087	66091	66092	66092	she	144	" O daddy ! "
66118	66156	66157	66157	she	144	" My little old daddy ! I 'm so glad . I do n't think I shall want anything else when we 've got a little garden ; and I knew Aaron would dig it for us , "
66162	66168	66157	66157	she	144	triumph-"I knew that very well . "
66169	66180	66182	66182	Silas	32	" You 're a deep little puss , you are , "
66198	66210	66182	66182	Silas	32	" but you 'll make yourself fine and beholden to Aaron . "
66211	66220	66222	66222	Eppie	144	" Oh , no , I sha n't , "
66228	66233	66222	66222	Eppie	144	" he likes it . "
66234	66260	66182	66182	Silas	32	" Come , come , let me carry your prayer - book , else you 'll be dropping it , jumping i ' that way . "
66450	66463	66400	66400	them	1757	" I have done my duty by this feeble creature , you perceive "
67161	67207	67147	67147	Eppie	144	" O daddy , you 're wanting to go into the sunshine to smoke your pipe . But I must clear away first , so as the house may be tidy when godmother comes . I 'll make haste - I wo n't be long . "
67237	67242	67147	67147	Eppie	144	" good for the fits "
67686	67739	67805	67805	She	109	" And yourn 's the same Bible , you 're sure o ' that , Master Marner - the Bible as you brought wi ' you from that country - it 's the same as what they 've got at church , and what Eppie 's a - learning to read in ? "
67740	67743	67745	67745	Silas	32	" Yes , "
67747	67767	67768	67768	he	32	" every bit the same ; and there 's drawing o ' lots in the Bible , mind you , "
67775	67782	67784	67784	Dolly	109	" Oh , dear , dear , "
67816	67942	67814	67814	she	109	" There 's wise folks , happen , as know how it all is ; the parson knows , I 'll be bound ; but it takes big words to tell them things , and such as poor folks ca n't make much out on . I can never rightly know the meaning o ' what I hear at church , only a bit here and there , but I know it 's good words - I do . But what lies upo ' your mind - it 's this , Master Marner : as , if Them above had done the right thing by you , They 'd never ha ' let you be turned out for a wicked thief when you was innicent . "
67943	67946	67948	67948	Silas	32	" Ah ! "
67960	68048	67948	67948	Silas	32	" that was what fell on me like as if it had been red - hot iron ; because , you see , there was nobody as cared for me or clave to me above nor below . And him as I 'd gone out and in wi ' for ten year and more , since when we was lads and went halves - mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted , had lifted up his heel again ' me , and worked to ruin me . "
68049	68069	68071	68071	Dolly	109	" Eh , but he was a bad un - I ca n't think as there 's another such , "
68073	68194	68071	68071	Dolly	109	" But I 'm o'ercome , Master Marner ; I 'm like as if I 'd waked and did n't know whether it was night or morning . I feel somehow as sure as I do when I 've laid something up though I ca n't justly put my hand on it , as there was a rights in what happened to you , if one could but make it out ; and you 'd no call to lose heart as you did . But we 'll talk on it again ; for sometimes things come into my head when I 'm leeching or poulticing , or such , as I could never think on when I was sitting still . "
68227	68231	68232	68232	she	109	" Master Marner , "
68247	68413	68238	68238	she	109	" I 've been sore puzzled for a good bit wi ' that trouble o ' yourn and the drawing o ' lots ; and it got twisted back'ards and for'ards , as I did n't know which end to lay hold on . But it come to me all clear like , that night when I was sitting up wi ' poor Bessy Fawkes , as is dead and left her children behind , God help 'em - it come to me as clear as daylight ; but whether I 've got hold on it now , or can anyways bring it to my tongue 's end , that I do n't know . For I 've often a deal inside me as'll never come out ; and for what you talk o ' your folks in your old country niver saying prayers by heart nor saying 'em out of a book , they must be wonderful cliver ; for if I did n't know "
68416	68453	68238	68238	she	109	" , and little bits o ' good words as I can carry out o ' church wi ' me , I might down o ' my knees every night , but nothing could I say . "
68454	68471	68473	68473	Silas	32	" But you can mostly say something as I can make sense on , Mrs. Winthrop , "
68475	68988	68238	68238	she	109	" Well , then , Master Marner , it come to me summat like this : I can make nothing o ' the drawing o ' lots and the answer coming wrong ; it ' ud mayhap take the parson to tell that , and he could only tell us i ' big words . But what come to me as clear as the daylight , it was when I was troubling over poor Bessy Fawkes , and it allays comes into my head when I 'm sorry for folks , and feel as I ca n't do a power to help 'em , not if I was to get up i ' the middle o ' the night - it comes into my head as Them above has got a deal tenderer heart nor what I 've got - for I ca n't be anyways better nor Them as made me ; and if anything looks hard to me , it 's because there 's things I do n't know on ; and for the matter o ' that , there may be plenty o ' things I do n't know on , for it 's little as I know - that it is . And so , while I was thinking o ' that , you come into my mind , Master Marner , and it all come pouring in:-if _ I _ felt i ' my inside what was the right and just thing by you , and them as prayed and drawed the lots , all but that wicked un , if _ they_'d ha ' done the right thing by you if they could , is n't there Them as was at the making on us , and knows better and has a better will ? And that 's all as ever I can be sure on , and everything else is a big puzzle to me when I think on it . For there was the fever come and took off them as were full - growed , and left the helpless children ; and there 's the breaking o ' limbs ; and them as ' ud do right and be sober have to suffer by them as are contrairy - eh , there 's trouble i ' this world , and there 's things as we can niver make out the rights on . And all as we 've got to do is to trusten , Master Marner - to do the right thing as fur as we know , and to trusten . For if us as knows so little can see a bit o ' good and rights , we may be sure as there 's a good and a rights bigger nor what we can know - I feel it i ' my own inside as it must be so . And if you could but ha ' gone on trustening , Master Marner , you would n't ha ' run away from your fellow - creaturs and been so lone . "
68989	69001	69003	69003	Silas	32	" Ah , but that ' ud ha ' been hard , "
69011	69023	69003	69003	Silas	32	" it ' ud ha ' been hard to trusten then . "
69024	69030	69032	69032	Dolly	109	" And so it would , "
69038	69056	69032	69032	Dolly	109	" them things are easier said nor done ; and I 'm partly ashamed o ' talking . "
69057	69062	69064	69064	Silas	32	" Nay , nay , "
69066	69154	69064	69064	Silas	32	" you 're i ' the right , Mrs. Winthrop - you're i ' the right . There 's good i ' this world - I've a feeling o ' that now ; and it makes a man feel as there 's a good more nor he can see , i ' spite o ' the trouble and the wickedness . That drawing o ' the lots is dark ; but the child was sent to me : there 's dealings with us - there 's dealings . "
69830	69833	69834	69834	she	144	" Father , "
69857	69902	69834	69834	she	144	" we shall take the furze bush into the garden ; it 'll come into the corner , and just against it I 'll put snowdrops and crocuses , 'cause Aaron says they wo n't die out , but'll always get more and more . "
69903	69908	69910	69910	Silas	32	" Ah , child , "
69934	70025	69917	69917	he	32	" it would n't do to leave out the furze bush ; and there 's nothing prettier , to my thinking , when it 's yallow with flowers . But it 's just come into my head what we 're to do for a fence - mayhap Aaron can help us to a thought ; but a fence we must have , else the donkeys and things ' ull come and trample everything down . And fencing 's hard to be got at , by what I can make out . "
70026	70036	70038	70038	Eppie	144	" Oh , I 'll tell you , daddy , "
70051	70103	70038	70038	Eppie	144	" There 's lots o ' loose stones about , some of 'em not big , and we might lay 'em atop of one another , and make a wall . You and me could carry the smallest , and Aaron ' ud carry the rest - I know he would . "
70104	70111	70113	70113	Silas	32	" Eh , my precious un , "
70115	70159	70160	70160	he	32	" there is n't enough stones to go all round ; and as for you carrying , why , wi ' your little arms you could n't carry a stone no bigger than a turnip . You 're dillicate made , my dear , "
70166	70173	70038	70038	Eppie	144	intonation-"that 's what Mrs. Winthrop says . "
70174	70186	70188	70188	Eppie	144	" Oh , I 'm stronger than you think , daddy , "
70190	70241	70188	70188	Eppie	144	" and if there was n't stones enough to go all round , why they 'll go part o ' the way , and then it 'll be easier to get sticks and things for the rest . See here , round the big pit , what a many stones ! "
70268	70279	70280	70280	she	144	" Oh , father , just come and look here , "
70281	70303	70242	70242	She	144	exclaimed-"come and see how the water 's gone down since yesterday . Why , yesterday the pit was ever so full ! "
70304	70311	70313	70313	Silas	32	" Well , to be sure , "
70320	70360	70313	70313	Silas	32	" Why , that 's the draining they 've begun on , since harvest , i ' Mr. Osgood 's fields , I reckon . The foreman said to me the other day , when I passed by 'em , "
70364	70368	70361	70362	Master Marner	37	" he said , "
70387	70414	70313	70313	Silas	32	" It was Mr. Godfrey Cass , he said , had gone into the draining : he 'd been taking these fields o ' Mr. Osgood . "
70415	70429	70431	70431	Eppie	144	" How odd it 'll seem to have the old pit dried up ! "
70445	70457	70458	70458	she	144	" See , daddy , I can carry this quite well , "
70477	70490	70492	70492	Silas	32	" Ah , you 're fine and strong , are n't you ? "
70503	70553	70495	70495	Eppie	144	" Come , come , let us go and sit down on the bank against the stile there , and have no more lifting . You might hurt yourself , child . You 'd need have somebody to work for you - and my arm is n't over strong . "
70646	70649	70651	70651	Eppie	144	" Father , "
70667	70686	70651	70651	Eppie	144	" if I was to be married , ought I to be married with my mother 's ring ? "
70720	70734	70779	70779	he	32	" Why , Eppie , have you been a - thinking on it ? "
70735	70743	70745	70745	Eppie	144	" Only this last week , father , "
70749	70758	70745	70745	Eppie	144	" since Aaron talked to me about it . "
70759	70766	70768	70768	Silas	32	" And what did he say ? "
70798	70869	70779	70779	he	32	" He said he should like to be married , because he was a - going in four - and - twenty , and had got a deal of gardening work , now Mr. Mott 's given up ; and he goes twice a - week regular to Mr. Cass 's , and once to Mr. Osgood 's , and they 're going to take him on at the Rectory . "
70870	70882	70884	70884	Silas	32	" And who is it as he 's wanting to marry ? "
70892	70903	70905	70905	Eppie	144	" Why , me , to be sure , daddy , "
70917	70928	70905	70905	Eppie	144	" as if he 'd want to marry anybody else ! "
70929	70940	70942	70942	Silas	32	" And you mean to have him , do you ? "
70944	70950	70952	70952	Eppie	144	" Yes , some time , "
70954	70994	70952	70952	Eppie	144	" I do n't know when . Everybody 's married some time , Aaron says . But I told him that was n't true : for , I said , look at father - he 's never been married . "
70995	71000	71002	71002	Silas	32	" No , child , "
71004	71018	71002	71002	Silas	32	" your father was a lone man till you was sent to him . "
71019	71030	71032	71032	Eppie	144	" But you 'll never be lone again , father , "
71036	71041	71002	71002	Silas	32	" That was what Aaron said-"I
71056	71061	71054	71054	Eppie	144	" And I said , "
71074	71121	71072	71072	Aaron	84	" And he wants us all to live together , so as you need n't work a bit , father , only what 's for your own pleasure ; and he 'd be as good as a son to you - that was what he said . "
71122	71131	71133	71133	Silas	32	" And should you like that , Eppie ? "
71139	71148	71150	71150	Eppie	144	" I should n't mind it , father , "
71155	71230	71150	71150	Eppie	144	" And I should like things to be so as you need n't work much . But if it was n't for that , I 'd sooner things did n't change . I 'm very happy : I like Aaron to be fond of me , and come and see us often , and behave pretty to you - he always _ does _ behave pretty to you , does n't he , father ? "
71231	71241	71243	71243	Silas	32	" Yes , child , nobody could behave better , "
71247	71255	71243	71243	Silas	32	" He 's his mother 's lad . "
71256	71265	71267	71267	Eppie	144	" But I do n't want any change , "
71269	71334	71267	71267	Eppie	144	" I should like to go on a long , long while , just as we are . Only Aaron does want a change ; and he made me cry a bit - only a bit - because he said I did n't care for him , for if I cared for him I should want us to be married , as he did . "
71335	71342	71344	71344	Silas	32	" Eh , my blessed child , "
71362	71536	71537	71537	Silas	32	" you 're o'er young to be married . We 'll ask Mrs. Winthrop - we'll ask Aaron 's mother what _ she _ thinks : if there 's a right thing to do , she 'll come at it . But there 's this to be thought on , Eppie : things _ will _ change , whether we like it or no ; things wo n't go on for a long while just as they are and no difference . I shall get older and helplesser , and be a burden on you , belike , if I do n't go away from you altogether . Not as I mean you 'd think me a burden - I know you wouldn't - but it ' ud be hard upon you ; and when I look for'ard to that , I like to think as you 'd have somebody else besides me - somebody young and strong , as'll outlast your own life , and take care on you to the end . "
71563	71576	71578	71578	Eppie	144	" Then , would you like me to be married , father ? "
71588	71601	71603	71603	Silas	32	" I 'll not be the man to say no , Eppie , "
71607	71628	71603	71603	Silas	32	" but we 'll ask your godmother . She 'll wish the right thing by you and her son too . "
71629	71636	71638	71638	Eppie	144	" There they come , then , "
71640	71663	71665	71665	Eppie	144	" Let us go and meet 'em . Oh , the pipe ! wo n't you have it lit again , father ? "
71675	71680	71682	71682	Silas	32	" Nay , child , "
71684	71713	71682	71682	Silas	32	" I 've done enough for to - day . I think , mayhap , a little of it does me more good than so much at once . "
72032	72037	72039	72039	Nancy	62	" Now , father , "
72041	72075	72039	72039	Nancy	62	" _ is _ there any call for you to go home to tea ? May n't you just as well stay with us?-such a beautiful evening as it 's likely to be . "
72105	72114	72115	72115	he	61	" My dear , you must ask Priscilla , "
72129	72138	72115	72115	he	61	" She manages me and the farm too . "
72139	72151	72153	72153	Priscilla	74	" And reason good as I should manage you , father , "
72155	72251	72153	72153	Priscilla	74	" else you 'd be giving yourself your death with rheumatism . And as for the farm , if anything turns out wrong , as it ca n't but do in these times , there 's nothing kills a man so soon as having nobody to find fault with but himself . It 's a deal the best way o ' being master , to let somebody else do the ordering , and keep the blaming in your own hands . It ' ud save many a man a stroke , _ I _ believe . "
72252	72260	72262	72263	her father	1204	" Well , well , my dear , "
72270	72284	72262	72263	her father	1204	" I did n't say you do n't manage for everybody 's good . "
72285	72297	72299	72299	Nancy	62	" Then manage so as you may stay tea , Priscilla , "
72311	72328	72299	72299	Nancy	62	" Come now ; and we 'll go round the garden while father has his nap . "
72329	72457	72262	72263	her father	1204	" My dear child , he 'll have a beautiful nap in the gig , for I shall drive . And as for staying tea , I ca n't hear of it ; for there 's this dairymaid , now she knows she 's to be married , turned Michaelmas , she 'd as lief pour the new milk into the pig - trough as into the pans . That 's the way with 'em all : it 's as if they thought the world ' ud be new - made because they 're to be married . So come and let me put my bonnet on , and there 'll be time for us to walk round the garden while the horse is being put in . "
72494	72625	72627	72627	Priscilla	74	" I 'm as glad as anything at your husband 's making that exchange o ' land with cousin Osgood , and beginning the dairying . It 's a thousand pities you did n't do it before ; for it 'll give you something to fill your mind . There 's nothing like a dairy if folks want a bit o ' worrit to make the days pass . For as for rubbing furniture , when you can once see your face in a table there 's nothing else to look for ; but there 's always something fresh with the dairy ; for even in the depths o ' winter there 's some pleasure in conquering the butter , and making it come whether or no . My dear , "
72642	72655	72627	72627	Priscilla	74	" you 'll never be low when you 've got a dairy . "
72656	72661	72663	72663	Nancy	62	" Ah , Priscilla , "
72677	72726	72663	72663	Nancy	62	" but it wo n't make up to Godfrey : a dairy 's not so much to a man . And it 's only what he cares for that ever makes me low . I 'm contented with the blessings we have , if he could be contented . "
72727	72734	72736	72736	Priscilla	74	" It drives me past patience , "
72740	72886	72736	72736	Priscilla	74	" that way o ' the men - always wanting and wanting , and never easy with what they 've got : they ca n't sit comfortable in their chairs when they 've neither ache nor pain , but either they must stick a pipe in their mouths , to make 'em better than well , or else they must be swallowing something strong , though they 're forced to make haste before the next meal comes in . But joyful be it spoken , our father was never that sort o ' man . And if it had pleased God to make you ugly , like me , so as the men would n't ha ' run after you , we might have kept to our own family , and had nothing to do with folks as have got uneasy blood in their veins . "
72887	72897	72899	72899	Nancy	62	" Oh , do n't say so , Priscilla , "
72910	72984	72903	72903	she	62	" nobody has any occasion to find fault with Godfrey . It 's natural he should be disappointed at not having any children : every man likes to have somebody to work for and lay by for , and he always counted so on making a fuss with 'em when they were little . There 's many another man ' ud hanker more than he does . He 's the best of husbands . "
72985	72991	72993	72993	Priscilla	74	" Oh , I know , "
72998	73046	72993	72993	Priscilla	74	" I know the way o ' wives ; they set one on to abuse their husbands , and then they turn round on one and praise 'em as if they wanted to sell 'em . But father'll be waiting for me ; we must turn now . "
73092	73106	73108	73110	the old gentleman	2152	" I always _ would _ have a good horse , you know , "
73128	73145	73147	73147	Priscilla	74	" Mind you bring Nancy to the Warrens before the week 's out , Mr. Cass , "
73171	73195	73197	73197	Godfrey	61	" I shall just take a turn to the fields against the Stone - pits , Nancy , and look at the draining , "
73199	73212	73229	73229	Godfrey	61	" You 'll be in again by tea - time , dear ? "
73213	73226	73229	73229	Godfrey	61	" Oh , yes , I shall be back in an hour . "
73628	73642	73683	73683	Nancy	62	" I can do so little - have I done it all well ? "
73789	73799	73788	73790	its wounds:-"A man	2972	wounds:-"A man must have so much on his mind , "
74031	74093	74132	74132	she	62	" It is very different - it is much worse for a man to be disappointed in that way : a woman can always be satisfied with devoting herself to her husband , but a man wants something that will make him look forward more - and sitting by the fire is so much duller to him than to a woman . "
74385	74394	74377	74377	she	62	" it was right for sisters to dress alike "
74398	74415	74377	74377	she	62	" she would do what was right if she wore a gown dyed with cheese - colouring "
74671	74684	74686	74686	Godfrey	61	" But why should you think the child would turn out ill ? "
74692	74751	74686	74686	Godfrey	61	" She has thriven as well as child can do with the weaver ; and _ he _ adopted her . There is n't such a pretty little girl anywhere else in the parish , or one fitter for the station we could give her . Where can be the likelihood of her being a curse to anybody ? "
74752	74759	74761	74761	Nancy	62	" Yes , my dear Godfrey , "
74783	74912	74761	74761	Nancy	62	" The child may not turn out ill with the weaver . But , then , he did n't go to seek her , as we should be doing . It will be wrong : I feel sure it will . Do n't you remember what that lady we met at the Royston Baths told us about the child her sister adopted ? That was the only adopting I ever heard of : and the child was transported when it was twenty - three . Dear Godfrey , do n't ask me to do what I know is wrong : I should never be happy again . I know it 's very hard for _ you_-it 's easier for me - but it 's the will of Providence . "
75317	75322	75323	75323	she	62	" I was right , "
75336	75494	75323	75323	she	62	discussion-"I feel I was right to say him nay , though it hurt me more than anything ; but how good Godfrey has been about it ! Many men would have been very angry with me for standing out against their wishes ; and they might have thrown out that they 'd had ill - luck in marrying me ; but Godfrey has never been the man to say me an unkind word . It 's only what he ca n't hide : everything seems so blank to him , I know ; and the land - what a difference it ' ud make to him , when he goes to see after things , if he 'd children growing up that he was doing it all for ! But I wo n't murmur ; and perhaps if he 'd married a woman who 'd have had children , she 'd have vexed him in other ways . "
76061	76077	76078	76078	she	62	" I wonder if he 'll mind it less or more as he gets older , "
76081	76147	76078	76078	she	62	" I 'm afraid more . Aged people feel the miss of children : what would father do without Priscilla ? And if I die , Godfrey will be very lonely - not holding together with his brothers much . But I wo n't be over - anxious , and trying to make things out beforehand : I must do my best for the present . "
76216	76227	76213	76213	her	162	" Is your master come into the yard , Jane ? "
76228	76237	76239	76239	Jane	162	" No ' m , he is n't , "
76257	76271	76273	76273	Jane	162	" I do n't know whether you 've seen 'em , ' m , "
76279	76349	76273	76273	Jane	162	" but there 's folks making haste all one way , afore the front window . I doubt something 's happened . There 's niver a man to be seen i ' the yard , else I 'd send and see . I 've been up into the top attic , but there 's no seeing anything for trees . I hope nobody 's hurt , that 's all . "
76350	76364	76366	76366	Nancy	62	" Oh , no , I daresay there 's nothing much the matter , "
76368	76385	76366	76366	Nancy	62	" It 's perhaps Mr. Snell 's bull got out again , as he did before . "
76386	76400	76402	76402	Jane	162	" I wish he may n't gore anybody then , that 's all , "
76416	76424	76426	76426	Nancy	62	" That girl is always terrifying me , "
76428	76436	76426	76426	Nancy	62	" I wish Godfrey would come in . "
76616	76627	76628	76628	she	62	" Dear , I 'm so thankful you 're come , "
76635	76640	76628	76628	she	62	" I began to get- "
76728	76738	76740	76740	Godfrey	61	" Tell her to keep away , will you ? "
76757	76765	76766	76766	he	61	" Sit down , Nancy - there , "
76776	76815	76766	76766	he	61	" I came back as soon as I could , to hinder anybody 's telling you but me . I 've had a great shock - but I care most about the shock it 'll be to you . "
76816	76824	76826	76826	Nancy	62	" It is n't father and Priscilla ? "
76841	76849	76851	76851	Godfrey	61	" No , it 's nobody living , "
76869	76899	76851	76851	Godfrey	61	" It 's Dunstan - my brother Dunstan , that we lost sight of sixteen years ago . We 've found him - found his body - his skeleton . "
76936	77017	76932	76932	He	61	" The Stone - pit has gone dry suddenly - from the draining , I suppose ; and there he lies - has lain for sixteen years , wedged between two great stones . There 's his watch and seals , and there 's my gold - handled hunting - whip , with my name on : he took it away , without my knowing , the day he went hunting on Wildfire , the last time he was seen . "
77032	77040	77042	77042	Nancy	62	" Do you think he drowned himself ? "
77075	77082	77084	77084	Godfrey	61	" No , he fell in , "
77108	77118	77105	77105	he	61	" Dunstan was the man that robbed Silas Marner . "
77152	77156	77157	77157	she	62	" O Godfrey ! "
77184	77193	77194	77194	he	61	" There was the money in the pit , "
77195	77235	77157	77157	she	62	continued-"all the weaver 's money . Everything 's been gathered up , and they 're taking the skeleton to the Rainbow . But I came back to tell you : there was no hindering it ; you must know . "
77303	77385	77301	77301	he	61	" Everything comes to light , Nancy , sooner or later . When God Almighty wills it , our secrets are found out . I 've lived with a secret on my mind , but I 'll keep it from you no longer . I would n't have you know it by somebody else , and not by me - I would n't have you find it out after I 'm dead . I 'll tell you now . It 's been "
77388	77390	77301	77301	he	61	" and "
77394	77408	77301	77301	he	61	" with me all my life - I'll make sure of myself now . "
77437	77440	77442	77442	Godfrey	61	" Nancy , "
77446	77492	77442	77442	Godfrey	61	" when I married you , I hid something from you - something I ought to have told you . That woman Marner found dead in the snow - Eppie 's mother - that wretched woman - was my wife : Eppie is my child . "
77537	77548	77550	77550	Godfrey	61	" You 'll never think the same of me again , "
77568	77614	77564	77564	She	62	" I ought n't to have left the child unowned : I ought n't to have kept it from you . But I could n't bear to give you up , Nancy . I was led away into marrying her - I suffered for it . "
77692	77738	77669	77669	she	62	" Godfrey , if you had but told me this six years ago , we could have done some of our duty by the child . Do you think I 'd have refused to take her in , if I 'd known she was yours ? "
77786	77858	77778	77778	she	62	" And - Oh , Godfrey - if we 'd had her from the first , if you 'd taken to her as you ought , she 'd have loved me for her mother - and you 'd have been happier with me : I could better have bore my little baby dying , and our life might have been more like what we used to think it ' ud be . "
77869	77887	77889	77889	Godfrey	61	" But you would n't have married me then , Nancy , if I 'd told you , "
77915	77955	77889	77889	Godfrey	61	" You may think you would now , but you would n't then . With your pride and your father 's , you 'd have hated having anything to do with me after the talk there 'd have been . "
77956	78013	78025	78025	she	62	" I ca n't say what I should have done about that , Godfrey . I should never have married anybody else . But I was n't worth doing wrong for - nothing is in this world . Nothing is so good as it seems beforehand - not even our marrying was n't , you see . "
78031	78045	78047	78047	Godfrey	61	" I 'm a worse man than you thought I was , Nancy , "
78052	78059	78047	78047	Godfrey	61	" Can you forgive me ever ? "
78060	78109	77889	77889	Godfrey	61	" The wrong to me is but little , Godfrey : you 've made it up to me - you've been good to me for fifteen years . It 's another you did the wrong to ; and I doubt it can never be all made up for . "
78110	78118	78120	78120	Godfrey	61	" But we can take Eppie now , "
78122	78147	78120	78120	Godfrey	61	" I wo n't mind the world knowing at last . I 'll be plain and open for the rest o ' my life . "
78148	78163	78165	78165	Nancy	62	" It 'll be different coming to us , now she 's grown up , "
78172	78206	78168	78168	her	62	" But it 's your duty to acknowledge her and provide for her ; and I 'll do my part by her , and pray to God Almighty to make her love me . "
78207	78233	78120	78120	Godfrey	61	" Then we 'll go together to Silas Marner 's this very night , as soon as everything 's quiet at the Stone - pits . "
78406	78412	78444	78444	She	144	" beauty born of murmuring sound "
78542	78560	78561	78561	he	32	" At first , I 'd a sort o ' feeling come across me now and then , "
78569	78702	78561	78561	he	32	" as if you might be changed into the gold again ; for sometimes , turn my head which way I would , I seemed to see the gold ; and I thought I should be glad if I could feel it , and find it was come back . But that did n't last long . After a bit , I should have thought it was a curse come again , if it had drove you from me , for I 'd got to feel the need o ' your looks and your voice and the touch o ' your little fingers . You did n't know then , Eppie , when you were such a little un - you did n't know what your old father Silas felt for you . "
78703	78711	78713	78713	Eppie	144	" But I know now , father , "
78715	78743	78713	78713	Eppie	144	" If it had n't been for you , they 'd have taken me to the workhouse , and there 'd have been nobody to love me . "
78744	78813	78561	78561	he	32	" Eh , my precious child , the blessing was mine . If you had n't been sent to save me , I should ha ' gone to the grave in my misery . The money was taken away from me in time ; and you see it 's been kept - kept till it was wanted for you . It 's wonderful - our life is wonderful . "
78827	78836	78837	78837	he	32	" It takes no hold of me now , "
78840	78886	78837	78837	he	32	ponderingly-"the money does n't . I wonder if it ever could again - I doubt it might , if I lost you , Eppie . I might come to think I was forsaken again , and lose the feeling that God was good to me . "
78966	78977	78979	78980	Mrs. Cass	149	" We 're disturbing you very late , my dear , "
79029	79034	79036	79036	Godfrey	149	" Well , Marner , "
79045	79145	79036	79036	Godfrey	149	" it 's a great comfort to me to see you with your money again , that you 've been deprived of so many years . It was one of my family did you the wrong - the more grief to me - and I feel bound to make up to you for it in every way . Whatever I can do for you will be nothing but paying a debt , even if I looked no further than the robbery . But there are other things I 'm beholden - shall be beholden to you for , Marner . "
79235	79237	79241	79242	Mr. Cass	61	" betters "
79260	79304	79241	79242	Mr. Cass	61	" Sir , I 've a deal to thank you for a'ready . As for the robbery , I count it no loss to me . And if I did , you could n't help it : you are n't answerable for it . "
79305	79359	79241	79242	Mr. Cass	61	" You may look at it in that way , Marner , but I never can ; and I hope you 'll let me act according to my own feeling of what 's just . I know you 're easily contented : you 've been a hard - working man all your life . "
79360	79367	79369	79369	Marner	32	" Yes , sir , yes , "
79373	79399	79369	79369	Marner	32	" I should ha ' been bad off without my work : it was what I held by when everything else was gone from me . "
79400	79403	79405	79405	Godfrey	61	" Ah , "
79417	79488	79405	79405	Godfrey	61	" it was a good trade for you in this country , because there 's been a great deal of linen - weaving to be done . But you 're getting rather past such close work , Marner : it 's time you laid by and had some rest . You look a good deal pulled down , though you 're not an old man , _ are _ you ? "
79489	79503	79505	79505	Silas	32	" Fifty - five , as near as I can say , sir , "
79507	79596	79405	79405	Godfrey	61	" Oh , why , you may live thirty years longer - look at old Macey ! And that money on the table , after all , is but little . It wo n't go far either way - whether it 's put out to interest , or you were to live on it as long as it would last : it would n't go far if you 'd nobody to keep but yourself , and you 've had two to keep for a good many years now . "
79597	79602	79604	79604	Silas	32	" Eh , sir , "
79613	79687	79604	79604	Silas	32	" I 'm in no fear o ' want . We shall do very well - Eppie and me ' ull do well enough . There 's few working - folks have got so much laid by as that . I do n't know what it is to gentlefolks , but I look upon it as a deal - almost too much . And as for us , it 's little we want . "
79688	79695	79697	79697	Eppie	144	" Only the garden , father , "
79708	79720	79722	79722	Nancy	62	" You love a garden , do you , my dear ? "
79738	79755	79722	79722	Nancy	62	" We should agree in that : I give a deal of time to the garden . "
79756	79769	79771	79771	Godfrey	61	" Ah , there 's plenty of gardening at the Red House , "
79794	79907	79771	79771	Godfrey	61	" You 've done a good part by Eppie , Marner , for sixteen years . It ' ud be a great comfort to you to see her well provided for , would n't it ? She looks blooming and healthy , but not fit for any hardships : she does n't look like a strapping girl come of working parents . You 'd like to see her taken care of by those who can leave her well off , and make a lady of her ; she 's more fit for it than for a rough life , such as she might come to have in a few years ' time . "
79953	79963	79964	79964	he	32	" I do n't take your meaning , sir , "
79987	79997	79999	79999	Godfrey	61	" Well , my meaning is this , Marner , "
80008	80172	79999	79999	Godfrey	61	" Mrs. Cass and I , you know , have no children - nobody to benefit by our good home and everything else we have - more than enough for ourselves . And we should like to have somebody in the place of a daughter to us - we should like to have Eppie , and treat her in every way as our own child . It ' ud be a great comfort to you in your old age , I hope , to see her fortune made in that way , after you 've been at the trouble of bringing her up so well . And it 's right you should have every reward for that . And Eppie , I 'm sure , will always love you and be grateful to you : she 'd come and see you very often , and we should all be on the look - out to do everything we could towards making you comfortable . "
80310	80332	80306	80306	he	1949	" Eppie , my child , speak . I wo n't stand in your way . Thank Mr. and Mrs. Cass . "
80397	80438	80379	80379	She	144	" Thank you , ma'am - thank you , sir . But I ca n't leave my father , nor own anybody nearer than him . And I do n't want to be a lady - thank you all the same "
80447	80461	80379	80379	She	144	" I could n't give up the folks I 've been used to . "
80652	80714	80642	80642	he	61	" But I 've a claim on you , Eppie - the strongest of all claims . It 's my duty , Marner , to own Eppie as my child , and provide for her . She is my own child - her mother was my wife . I 've a natural claim on her that must stand before every other . "
80774	80779	80780	80780	he	32	" Then , sir , "
80803	80900	80934	80934	Silas	32	perished-"then , sir , why did n't you say so sixteen year ago , and claim her before I 'd come to love her , i'stead o ' coming to take her from me now , when you might as well take the heart out o ' my body ? God gave her to me because you turned your back upon her , and He looks upon her as mine : you 've no right to her ! When a man turns a blessing from his door , it falls to them as take it in . "
80901	80922	80924	80924	Godfrey	61	" I know that , Marner . I was wrong . I 've repented of my conduct in that matter , "
80938	80948	80950	80950	Marner	32	" I 'm glad to hear it , sir , "
80956	80976	80950	80950	Marner	32	" but repentance does n't alter what 's been going on for sixteen year . Your coming now and saying "
80981	81007	80934	80934	Silas	32	" does n't alter the feelings inside us . It 's me she 's been calling her father ever since she could say the word . "
81008	81023	81025	81025	Godfrey	61	" But I think you might look at the thing more reasonably , Marner , "
81038	81087	81025	81025	Godfrey	61	" It is n't as if she was to be taken quite away from you , so that you 'd never see her again . She 'll be very near you , and come to see you very often . She 'll feel just the same towards you . "
81088	81093	81095	81095	Marner	32	" Just the same ? "
81102	81166	81095	81095	Marner	32	" How 'll she feel just the same for me as she does now , when we eat o ' the same bit , and drink o ' the same cup , and think o ' the same things from one day 's end to another ? Just the same ? that 's idle talk . You 'd cut us i ' two . "
81240	81248	81249	81249	he	61	" I should have thought , Marner , "
81252	81407	81249	81249	he	61	severely-"I should have thought your affection for Eppie would make you rejoice in what was for her good , even if it did call upon you to give up something . You ought to remember your own life 's uncertain , and she 's at an age now when her lot may soon be fixed in a way very different from what it would be in her father 's home : she may marry some low working - man , and then , whatever I might do for her , I could n't make her well - off . You 're putting yourself in the way of her welfare ; and though I 'm sorry to hurt you after what you 've done , and what I 've left undone , I feel now it 's my duty to insist on taking care of my own daughter . I want to do my duty . "
81641	81665	81617	81617	he	32	" I 'll say no more . Let it be as you will . Speak to the child . I 'll hinder nothing . "
81757	81759	81720	81720	her	62	" respectability "
81835	81841	81843	81843	Godfrey	61	" Eppie , my dear , "
81867	81997	81859	81859	she	62	" it 'll always be our wish that you should show your love and gratitude to one who 's been a father to you so many years , and we shall want to help you to make him comfortable in every way . But we hope you 'll come to love us as well ; and though I have n't been what a father should ha ' been to you all these years , I wish to do the utmost in my power for you for the rest of my life , and provide for you as my only child . And you 'll have the best of mothers in my wife - that'll be a blessing you have n't known since you were old enough to know it . "
81998	82010	82012	82012	Nancy	62	" My dear , you 'll be a treasure to me , "
82019	82031	82012	82012	Nancy	62	" We shall want for nothing when we have our daughter . "
82089	82239	82081	82081	she	144	" Thank you , ma'am - thank you , sir , for your offers - they're very great , and far above my wish . For I should have no delight i ' life any more if I was forced to go away from my father , and knew he was sitting at home , a - thinking of me and feeling lone . We 've been used to be happy together every day , and I ca n't think o ' no happiness without him . And he says he 'd nobody i ' the world till I was sent to him , and he 'd have nothing when I was gone . And he 's took care of me and loved me from the first , and I 'll cleave to him as long as he lives , and nobody shall ever come between him and me . "
82240	82249	82251	82251	Silas	32	" But you must make sure , Eppie , "
82256	82299	82251	82251	Silas	32	voice-"you must make sure as you wo n't ever be sorry , because you 've made your choice to stay among poor folks , and with poor clothes and things , when you might ha ' had everything o ' the best . "
82318	82327	82329	82329	Eppie	144	" I can never be sorry , father , "
82331	82412	82329	82329	Eppie	144	" I should n't know what to think on or to wish for with fine things about me , as I have n't been used to . And it ' ud be poor work for me to put on things , and ride in a gig , and sit in a place at church , as ' ud make them as I 'm fond of think me unfitting company for 'em . What could _ I _ care for then ? "
82469	82494	82495	82495	she	144	" What you say is natural , my dear child - it 's natural you should cling to those who 've brought you up , "
82500	82550	82495	82495	she	144	" but there 's a duty you owe to your lawful father . There 's perhaps something to be given up on more sides than one . When your father opens his home to you , I think it 's right you should n't turn your back on it . "
82551	82565	82567	82567	Eppie	144	" I ca n't feel as I 've got any father but one , "
82576	82651	82652	82652	she	144	" I 've always thought of a little home where he 'd sit i ' the corner , and I should fend and do everything for him : I ca n't think o ' no other home . I was n't brought up to be a lady , and I ca n't turn my mind to it . I like the working - folks , and their victuals , and their ways . And , "
82661	82686	82652	82652	she	144	" I 'm promised to marry a working - man , as'll live with father , and help me to take care of him . "
82743	82748	82749	82749	he	61	" Let us go , "
82758	82769	82771	82771	Nancy	62	" We wo n't talk of this any longer now , "
82775	82806	82771	82771	Nancy	62	" We 're your well - wishers , my dear - and yours too , Marner . We shall come and see you again . It 's getting late now . "
82998	83003	82990	82990	he	61	" That 's ended ! "
83021	83072	83015	83015	she	62	" Yes , I 'm afraid we must give up the hope of having her for a daughter . It would n't be right to want to force her to come to us against her will . We ca n't alter her bringing up and what 's come of it . "
83073	83076	83078	83078	Godfrey	61	" No , "
83095	83186	83078	83078	Godfrey	61	speech-"there 's debts we ca n't pay like money debts , by paying extra for the years that have slipped by . While I 've been putting off and putting off , the trees have been growing - it 's too late now . Marner was in the right in what he said about a man 's turning away a blessing from his door : it falls to somebody else . I wanted to pass for childless once , Nancy - I shall pass for childless now against my wish . "
83199	83215	83198	83198	she	62	asked-"You wo n't make it known , then , about Eppie 's being your daughter ? "
83216	83256	83198	83198	she	62	" No : where would be the good to anybody?-only harm . I must do what I can for her in the state of life she chooses . I must see who it is she 's thinking of marrying . "
83257	83271	83273	83273	Nancy	62	" If it wo n't do any good to make the thing known , "
83296	83334	83289	83289	she	62	" I should be very thankful for father and Priscilla never to be troubled with knowing what was done in the past , more than about Dunsey : it ca n't be helped , their knowing that . "
83335	83371	83373	83373	Godfrey	61	" I shall put it in my will - I think I shall put it in my will . I should n't like to leave anything to be found out , like this of Dunsey , "
83377	83415	83416	83416	he	61	" But I ca n't see anything but difficulties that ' ud come from telling it now . I must do what I can to make her happy in her own way . I 've a notion , "
83425	83450	83416	83416	he	61	" it 's Aaron Winthrop she meant she was engaged to . I remember seeing him with her and Marner going away from church . "
83451	83461	83463	83463	Nancy	62	" Well , he 's very sober and industrious , "
83491	83507	83482	83482	he	61	" She 's a very pretty , nice girl , is n't she , Nancy ? "
83508	83530	83482	83482	he	61	" Yes , dear ; and with just your hair and eyes : I wondered it had never struck me before . "
83531	83560	83482	83482	he	61	" I think she took a dislike to me at the thought of my being her father : I could see a change in her manner after that . "
83561	83577	83579	83579	Nancy	62	" She could n't bear to think of not looking on Marner as her father , "
83591	83694	83482	83482	he	61	" She thinks I did wrong by her mother as well as by her . She thinks me worse than I am . But she _ must _ think it : she can never know all . It 's part of my punishment , Nancy , for my daughter to dislike me . I should never have got into that trouble if I 'd been true to you - if I had n't been a fool . I 'd no right to expect anything but evil could come of that marriage - and when I shirked doing a father 's part too . "
83748	83784	83722	83722	He	1986	" And I got _ you _ , Nancy , in spite of all ; and yet I 've been grumbling and uneasy because I had n't something else - as if I deserved it . "
83785	83796	83798	83798	Nancy	62	" You 've never been wanting to me , Godfrey , "
83804	83824	83798	83798	Nancy	62	" My only trouble would be gone if you resigned yourself to the lot that 's been given us . "
83825	83857	83872	83872	he	1986	" Well , perhaps it is n't too late to mend a bit there . Though it _ is _ too late to mend some things , say what they will . "
83876	83969	83872	83872	he	1986	" Eppie , there 's a thing I 've had on my mind to do this two year , and now the money 's been brought back to us , we can do it . I 've been turning it over and over in the night , and I think we 'll set out to - morrow , while the fine days last . We 'll leave the house and everything for your godmother to take care on , and we 'll make a little bundle o ' things and set out . "
83970	83977	83979	83979	Eppie	144	" Where to go , daddy ? "
83985	84087	83872	83872	he	1986	" To my old country - to the town where I was born - up Lantern Yard . I want to see Mr. Paston , the minister : something may ha ' come out to make 'em know I was innicent o ' the robbery . And Mr. Paston was a man with a deal o ' light - I want to speak to him about the drawing o ' the lots . And I should like to talk to him about the religion o ' this country - side , for I partly think he does n't know on it . "
84212	84231	84323	84323	Silas	32	" You 'd be easier in your mind for the rest o ' your life , Master Marner , "
84233	84280	84323	84323	Silas	32	Dolly-"that you would . And if there 's any light to be got up the yard as you talk on , we 've need of it i ' this world , and I 'd be glad on it myself , if you could bring it back . "
84367	84402	84404	84404	Eppie	144	" Ask for Lantern Yard , father - ask this gentleman with the tassels on his shoulders a - standing at the shop door ; he is n't in a hurry like the rest , "
84437	84451	84453	84453	Silas	32	" Eh , my child , he wo n't know anything about it , "
84455	84500	84453	84453	Silas	32	" gentlefolks did n't ever go up the Yard . But happen somebody can tell me which is the way to Prison Street , where the jail is . I know the way out o ' that as if I 'd seen it yesterday . "
84565	84568	84569	84569	he	32	" Ah , "
84577	84619	84569	84569	he	32	" there 's the jail , Eppie ; that 's just the same : I are n't afraid now . It 's the third turning on the left hand from the jail doors - that 's the way we must go . "
84620	84629	84631	84631	Eppie	144	" Oh , what a dark ugly place ! "
84633	84668	84631	84631	Eppie	144	" How it hides the sky ! It 's worse than the Workhouse . I 'm glad you do n't live in this town now , father . Is Lantern Yard like this street ? "
84669	84674	84676	84676	Silas	32	" My precious child , "
84680	84739	84676	84676	Silas	32	" it is n't a big street like this . I never was easy i ' this street myself , but I was fond o ' Lantern Yard . The shops here are all altered , I think - I ca n't make 'em out ; but I shall know the turning , because it 's the third . "
84740	84745	84746	84746	he	32	" Here it is , "
84763	84822	84746	84746	he	32	" And then we must go to the left again , and then straight for'ard for a bit , up Shoe Lane : and then we shall be at the entry next to the o'erhanging window , where there 's the nick in the road for the water to run . Eh , I can see it all . "
84823	84836	84838	84838	Eppie	144	" O father , I 'm like as if I was stifled , "
84840	84874	84838	84838	Eppie	144	" I could n't ha ' thought as any folks lived i ' this way , so close together . How pretty the Stone - pits ' ull look when we get back ! "
84875	84903	84746	84746	he	32	" It looks comical to _ me _ , child , now - and smells bad . I ca n't think as it usened to smell so . "
84956	84960	84962	84962	Silas	32	" Dear heart ! "
84964	84994	84962	84962	Silas	32	" why , there 's people coming out o ' the Yard as if they 'd been to chapel at this time o ' day - a weekday noon ! "
85036	85039	85041	85041	Eppie	144	" Father , "
85047	85053	85041	85041	Eppie	144	" what 's the matter ? "
85068	85075	85076	85076	he	32	" It 's gone , child , "
85084	85139	85076	85076	he	32	agitation-"Lantern Yard 's gone . It must ha ' been here , because here 's the house with the o'erhanging window - I know that - it 's just the same ; but they 've made this new opening ; and see that big factory ! It 's all gone - chapel and all . "
85140	85160	85162	85162	Eppie	144	" Come into that little brush - shop and sit down , father - they'll let you sit down , "
85180	85191	85076	85076	he	32	" Perhaps the people can tell you all about it . "
85245	85255	85256	85256	Silas	32	" The old place is all swep ' away , "
85266	85342	85256	85256	Silas	32	return-"the little graveyard and everything . The old home 's gone ; I 've no home but this now . I shall never know whether they got at the truth o ' the robbery , nor whether Mr. Paston could ha ' given me any light about the drawing o ' the lots . It 's dark to me , Mrs. Winthrop , that is ; I doubt it 'll be dark to the last . "
85343	85351	85353	85353	Dolly	109	" Well , yes , Master Marner , "
85369	85471	85353	85353	Dolly	109	" I doubt it may . It 's the will o ' Them above as a many things should be dark to us ; but there 's some things as I 've never felt i ' the dark about , and they 're mostly what comes i ' the day 's work . You were hard done by that once , Master Marner , and it seems as you 'll never know the rights of it ; but that does n't hinder there _ being _ a rights , Master Marner , for all it 's dark to you and me . "
85472	85475	85477	85477	Silas	32	" No , "
85479	85534	85477	85477	Silas	32	" no ; that does n't hinder . Since the time the child was sent to me and I 've come to love her as myself , I 've had light enough to trusten by ; and now she says she 'll never leave me , I think I shall trusten till I die . "
85800	85811	85812	85812	she	144	" You wo n't be giving me away , father , "
85821	85835	85812	85812	she	144	" you 'll only be taking Aaron to be a son to you . "
85977	85999	86001	86001	Priscilla	74	" I could ha ' wished Nancy had had the luck to find a child like that and bring her up , "
86013	86033	86001	86001	Priscilla	74	" I should ha ' had something young to think of then , besides the lambs and the calves . "
86034	86042	86044	86045	Mr. Lammeter	75	" Yes , my dear , yes , "
86047	86088	86044	86045	Mr. Lammeter	75	" one feels that as one gets older . Things look dim to old folks : they 'd need have some young eyes about 'em , to let 'em know the world 's the same as it used to be . "
86167	86178	86180	86180	Dolly	109	" Mr. Macey 's looking for a word from us , "
86182	86202	86180	86180	Dolly	109	" he 'll be hurt if we pass him and say nothing - and him so racked with rheumatiz . "
86229	86235	86236	86236	he	329	" Well , Master Marner , "
86248	86312	86236	86236	he	329	" I 've lived to see my words come true . I was the first to say there was no harm in you , though your looks might be again ' you ; and I was the first to say you 'd get your money back . And it 's nothing but rightful as you should . And I 'd ha ' said the "
86314	86345	86236	86236	he	329	" , and willing , at the holy matrimony ; but Tookey 's done it a good while now , and I hope you 'll have none the worse luck . "
86666	86670	86672	86672	Eppie	144	" O father , "
86674	86692	86672	86672	Eppie	144	" what a pretty home ours is ! I think nobody could be happier than we are . "
