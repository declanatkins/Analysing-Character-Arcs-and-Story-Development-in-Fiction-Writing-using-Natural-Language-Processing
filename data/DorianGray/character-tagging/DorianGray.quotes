389	406	408	409	Lord Henry	112	" It is your best work , Basil , the best thing you have ever done , "
412	488	408	409	Lord Henry	112	" You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor . The Academy is too large and too vulgar . Whenever I have gone there , there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures , which was dreadful , or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people , which was worse . The Grosvenor is really the only place . "
489	500	501	501	he	366	" I do n't think I shall send it anywhere , "
524	534	505	505	his	366	" No , I wo n't send it anywhere . "
569	683	538	538	his	112	" Not send it anywhere ? My dear fellow , why ? Have you any reason ? What odd chaps you painters are ! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation . As soon as you have one , you seem to want to throw it away . It is silly of you , for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about , and that is not being talked about . A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England , and make the old men quite jealous , if old men are ever capable of any emotion . "
684	693	694	694	he	366	" I know you will laugh at me , "
697	716	694	694	he	366	" but I really ca n't exhibit it . I have put too much of myself into it . "
728	746	538	538	his	112	" Yes , I knew you would ; but it is quite true , all the same . "
747	1045	538	538	his	112	" Too much of yourself in it ! Upon my word , Basil , I did n't know you were so vain ; and I really ca n't see any resemblance between you , with your rugged strong face and your coal - black hair , and this young Adonis , who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose - leaves . Why , my dear Basil , he is a Narcissus , and you - well , of course you have an intellectual expression and all that . But beauty , real beauty , ends where an intellectual expression begins . Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration , and destroys the harmony of any face . The moment one sits down to think , one becomes all nose , or all forehead , or something horrid . Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions . How perfectly hideous they are ! Except , of course , in the Church . But then in the Church they do n't think . A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen , and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful . Your mysterious young friend , whose name you have never told me , but whose picture really fascinates me , never thinks . I feel quite sure of that . He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at , and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence . Do n't flatter yourself , Basil : you are not in the least like him . "
1046	1055	1057	1058	the artist	365	" You do n't understand me , Harry , "
1060	1256	1057	1058	the artist	365	" Of course I am not like him . I know that perfectly well . Indeed , I should be sorry to look like him . You shrug your shoulders ? I am telling you the truth . There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction , the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings . It is better not to be different from one 's fellows . The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world . They can sit at their ease and gape at the play . If they know nothing of victory , they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat . They live as we all should live - undisturbed , indifferent , and without disquiet . They neither bring ruin upon others , nor ever receive it from alien hands . Your rank and wealth , Harry ; my brains , such as they are - my art , whatever it may be worth ; Dorian Gray 's good looks - we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us , suffer terribly . "
1257	1266	1268	1269	Lord Henry	112	" Dorian Gray ? Is that his name ? "
1279	1297	538	538	his	112	" Yes , that is his name . I did n't intend to tell it to you . "
1298	1303	538	538	his	112	" But why not ? "
1304	1434	538	538	his	112	" Oh , I ca n't explain . When I like people immensely , I never tell their names to any one . It is like surrendering a part of them . I have grown to love secrecy . It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us . The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it . When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going . If I did , I would lose all my pleasure . It is a silly habit , I dare say , but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one 's life . I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it ? "
1435	1440	1442	1443	Lord Henry	112	" Not at all , "
1445	1596	1442	1443	Lord Henry	112	" not at all , my dear Basil . You seem to forget that I am married , and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties . I never know where my wife is , and my wife never knows what I am doing . When we meet - we do meet occasionally , when we dine out together , or go down to the Duke's - we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces . My wife is very good at it - much better , in fact , than I am . She never gets confused over her dates , and I always do . But when she does find me out , she makes no row at all . I sometimes wish she would ; but she merely laughs at me . "
1597	1611	1613	1614	Basil Hallward	113	" I hate the way you talk about your married life , Harry , "
1626	1677	1613	1614	Basil Hallward	113	" I believe that you are really a very good husband , but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues . You are an extraordinary fellow . You never say a moral thing , and you never do a wrong thing . Your cynicism is simply a pose . "
1678	1694	1696	1697	Lord Henry	112	" Being natural is simply a pose , and the most irritating pose I know , "
1759	1770	1771	1771	he	112	" I am afraid I must be going , Basil , "
1774	1795	1771	1771	he	112	" and before I go , I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago . "
1796	1801	1803	1804	the painter	366	" What is that ? "
1814	1820	1771	1771	he	112	" You know quite well . "
1821	1828	1771	1771	he	112	" I do not , Harry . "
1829	1863	1771	1771	he	112	" Well , I will tell you what it is . I want you to explain to me why you wo n't exhibit Dorian Gray 's picture . I want the real reason . "
1864	1872	1771	1771	he	112	" I told you the real reason . "
1873	1900	1771	1771	he	112	" No , you did not . You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it . Now , that is childish . "
1901	1904	1906	1907	Basil Hallward	113	" Harry , "
1916	1998	1906	1907	Basil Hallward	113	" every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist , not of the sitter . The sitter is merely the accident , the occasion . It is not he who is revealed by the painter ; it is rather the painter who , on the coloured canvas , reveals himself . The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul . "
2003	2009	2010	2010	he	112	" And what is that ? "
2013	2019	2021	2021	Hallward	113	" I will tell you , "
2033	2041	2043	2044	his companion	374	" I am all expectation , Basil , "
2050	2063	2065	2066	the painter	366	" Oh , there is really very little to tell , Harry , "
2068	2086	2065	2066	the painter	366	" and I am afraid you will hardly understand it . Perhaps you will hardly believe it . "
2108	2118	2119	2119	he	112	" I am quite sure I shall understand it , "
2134	2153	2119	2119	he	112	" and as for believing things , I can believe anything , provided that it is quite incredible . "
2232	2239	2241	2242	the painter	366	" The story is simply this , "
2247	2568	2241	2242	the painter	366	" Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon 's . You know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time , just to remind the public that we are not savages . With an evening coat and a white tie , as you told me once , anybody , even a stock - broker , can gain a reputation for being civilized . Well , after I had been in the room about ten minutes , talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians , I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me . I turned half - way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time . When our eyes met , I felt that I was growing pale . A curious sensation of terror came over me . I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that , if I allowed it to do so , it would absorb my whole nature , my whole soul , my very art itself . I did not want any external influence in my life . You know yourself , Harry , how independent I am by nature . I have always been my own master ; had at least always been so , till I met Dorian Gray . Then - but I do n't know how to explain it to you . Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life . I had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows . I grew afraid and turned to quit the room . It was not conscience that made me do so : it was a sort of cowardice . I take no credit to myself for trying to escape . "
2569	2595	2241	2242	the painter	366	" Conscience and cowardice are really the same things , Basil . Conscience is the trade - name of the firm . That is all . "
2596	2680	2241	2242	the painter	366	" I do n't believe that , Harry , and I do n't believe you do either . However , whatever was my motive - and it may have been pride , for I used to be very proud - I certainly struggled to the door . There , of course , I stumbled against Lady Brandon . ' You are not going to run away so soon , Mr. Hallward ? ' she screamed out . You know her curiously shrill voice ? "
2681	2693	2695	2696	Lord Henry	112	" Yes ; she is a peacock in everything but beauty , "
2709	2907	2241	2242	the painter	366	" I could not get rid of her . She brought me up to royalties , and people with stars and garters , and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses . She spoke of me as her dearest friend . I had only met her once before , but she took it into her head to lionize me . I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time , at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers , which is the nineteenth - century standard of immortality . Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me . We were quite close , almost touching . Our eyes met again . It was reckless of me , but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him . Perhaps it was not so reckless , after all . It was simply inevitable . We would have spoken to each other without any introduction . I am sure of that . Dorian told me so afterwards . He , too , felt that we were destined to know each other . "
2908	2920	2922	2923	his companion	374	" And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man ? "
2925	3040	2922	2923	his companion	374	" I know she goes in for giving a rapid _ precis _ of all her guests . I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red - faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons , and hissing into my ear , in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room , the most astounding details . I simply fled . I like to find out people for myself . But Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods . She either explains them entirely away , or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know . "
3041	3054	3056	3056	Hallward	113	" Poor Lady Brandon ! You are hard on her , Harry ! "
3059	3100	2922	2923	his companion	374	" My dear fellow , she tried to found a _ salon _ , and only succeeded in opening a restaurant . How could I admire her ? But tell me , what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray ? "
3101	3165	2922	2923	his companion	374	" Oh , something like , ' Charming boy - poor dear mother and I absolutely inseparable . Quite forget what he does - afraid he - doesn't do anything - oh , yes , plays the piano - or is it the violin , dear Mr. Gray ? ' Neither of us could help laughing , and we became friends at once . "
3166	3189	3191	3193	the young lord	379	" Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship , and it is far the best ending for one , "
3204	3215	3216	3216	he	113	" You do n't understand what friendship is , Harry , "
3217	3243	2922	2923	his companion	374	murmured-"or what enmity is , for that matter . You like every one ; that is to say , you are indifferent to every one . "
3244	3251	3253	3254	Lord Henry	112	" How horribly unjust of you ! "
3288	3382	3257	3257	his	112	" Yes ; horribly unjust of you . I make a great difference between people . I choose my friends for their good looks , my acquaintances for their good characters , and my enemies for their good intellects . A man can not be too careful in the choice of his enemies . I have not got one who is a fool . They are all men of some intellectual power , and consequently they all appreciate me . Is that very vain of me ? I think it is rather vain . "
3383	3404	2922	2923	his companion	374	" I should think it was , Harry . But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance . "
3405	3419	3257	3257	his	112	" My dear old Basil , you are much more than an acquaintance . "
3420	3436	2922	2923	his companion	374	" And much less than a friend . A sort of brother , I suppose ? "
3437	3467	3257	3257	his	112	" Oh , brothers ! I do n't care for brothers . My elder brother wo n't die , and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else . "
3468	3471	3473	3473	Hallward	113	" Harry ! "
3477	3608	3257	3257	his	112	" My dear fellow , I am not quite serious . But I ca n't help detesting my relations . I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves . I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders . The masses feel that drunkenness , stupidity , and immorality should be their own special property , and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself , he is poaching on their preserves . When poor Southwark got into the divorce court , their indignation was quite magnificent . And yet I do n't suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly . "
3609	3639	3257	3257	his	112	" I do n't agree with a single word that you have said , and , what is more , Harry , I feel sure you do n't either . "
3663	3846	3643	3643	his	112	" How English you are Basil ! That is the second time you have made that observation . If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman - always a rash thing to do - he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong . The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself . Now , the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it . Indeed , the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is , the more purely intellectual will the idea be , as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants , his desires , or his prejudices . However , I do n't propose to discuss politics , sociology , or metaphysics with you . I like persons better than principles , and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world . Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray . How often do you see him ? "
3847	3872	3257	3257	his	112	" Every day . I could n't be happy if I did n't see him every day . He is absolutely necessary to me . "
3873	3889	3643	3643	his	112	" How extraordinary ! I thought you would never care for anything but your art . "
3890	3900	3902	3903	the painter	366	" He is all my art to me now , "
3906	4403	3902	3903	the painter	366	" I sometimes think , Harry , that there are only two eras of any importance in the world 's history . The first is the appearance of a new medium for art , and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also . What the invention of oil - painting was to the Venetians , the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture , and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me . It is not merely that I paint from him , draw from him , sketch from him . Of course , I have done all that . But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter . I wo n't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him , or that his beauty is such that art can not express it . There is nothing that art can not express , and I know that the work I have done , since I met Dorian Gray , is good work , is the best work of my life . But in some curious way - I wonder will you understand me?-his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art , an entirely new mode of style . I see things differently , I think of them differently . I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before . ' A dream of form in days of thought'-who is it who says that ? I forget ; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me . The merely visible presence of this lad - for he seems to me little more than a lad , though he is really over twenty - his merely visible presence - ah ! I wonder can you realize all that that means ? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school , a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit , all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek . The harmony of soul and body - how much that is ! We in our madness have separated the two , and have invented a realism that is vulgar , an ideality that is void . Harry ! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me ! You remember that landscape of mine , for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with ? It is one of the best things I have ever done . And why is it so ? Because , while I was painting it , Dorian Gray sat beside me . Some subtle influence passed from him to me , and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed . "
4404	4417	4796	4797	The painter	366	" Basil , this is extraordinary ! I must see Dorian Gray . "
4439	4442	4443	4443	he	113	" Harry , "
4446	4526	4443	4443	he	113	" Dorian Gray is to me simply a motive in art . You might see nothing in him . I see everything in him . He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there . He is a suggestion , as I have said , of a new manner . I find him in the curves of certain lines , in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours . That is all . "
4527	4537	4539	4540	Lord Henry	112	" Then why wo n't you exhibit his portrait ? "
4542	4639	4796	4797	The painter	366	" Because , without intending it , I have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry , of which , of course , I have never cared to speak to him . He knows nothing about it . He shall never know anything about it . But the world might guess it , and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes . My heart shall never be put under their microscope . There is too much of myself in the thing , Harry - too much of myself ! "
4640	4669	4443	4443	he	113	" Poets are not so scrupulous as you are . They know how useful passion is for publication . Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions . "
4670	4677	4679	4679	Hallward	113	" I hate them for it , "
4681	4756	4679	4679	Hallward	113	" An artist should create beautiful things , but should put nothing of his own life into them . We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography . We have lost the abstract sense of beauty . Some day I will show the world what it is ; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray . "
4757	4795	4443	4443	he	113	" I think you are wrong , Basil , but I wo n't argue with you . It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue . Tell me , is Dorian Gray very fond of you ? "
4804	4809	4810	4810	he	366	" He likes me , "
4816	4946	4810	4810	he	366	" I know he likes me . Of course I flatter him dreadfully . I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said . As a rule , he is charming to me , and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things . Now and then , however , he is horribly thoughtless , and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain . Then I feel , Harry , that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat , a bit of decoration to charm his vanity , an ornament for a summer 's day . "
4947	4959	4961	4962	Lord Henry	112	" Days in summer , Basil , are apt to linger , "
4964	5234	4961	4962	Lord Henry	112	" Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will . It is a sad thing to think of , but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty . That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over - educate ourselves . In the wild struggle for existence , we want to have something that endures , and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts , in the silly hope of keeping our place . The thoroughly well - informed man - that is the modern ideal . And the mind of the thoroughly well - informed man is a dreadful thing . It is like a _ bric - a - brac _ shop , all monsters and dust , with everything priced above its proper value . I think you will tire first , all the same . Some day you will look at your friend , and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing , or you wo n't like his tone of colour , or something . You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart , and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you . The next time he calls , you will be perfectly cold and indifferent . It will be a great pity , for it will alter you . What you have told me is quite a romance , a romance of art one might call it , and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic . "
5235	5272	4810	4810	he	366	" Harry , do n't talk like that . As long as I live , the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me . You ca n't feel what I feel . You change too often . "
5273	5311	4961	4962	Lord Henry	112	" Ah , my dear Basil , that is exactly why I can feel it . Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love : it is the faithless who know love 's tragedies . "
5567	5577	5560	5560	He	112	" My dear fellow , I have just remembered . "
5578	5584	5560	5560	He	112	" Remembered what , Harry ? "
5585	5595	5560	5560	He	112	" Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray . "
5596	5601	5603	5603	Hallward	113	" Where was it ? "
5610	5737	5560	5560	He	112	" Do n't look so angry , Basil . It was at my aunt , Lady Agatha 's . She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the East End , and that his name was Dorian Gray . I am bound to state that she never told me he was good - looking . Women have no appreciation of good looks ; at least , good women have not . She said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature . I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair , horribly freckled , and tramping about on huge feet . I wish I had known it was your friend . "
5738	5749	5858	5858	he	1982	" I am very glad you did n't , Harry . "
5750	5753	5560	5560	He	112	" Why ? "
5754	5764	5858	5858	he	1982	" I do n't want you to meet him . "
5765	5775	5560	5560	He	112	" You do n't want me to meet him ? "
5776	5779	5858	5858	he	1982	" No . "
5780	5791	5793	5794	the butler	396	" Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio , sir , "
5801	5808	5810	5811	Lord Henry	112	" You must introduce me now , "
5829	5847	5848	5849	The man	1982	" Ask Mr. Gray to wait , Parker : I shall be in in a few moments . "
5864	5872	5873	5873	he	1982	" Dorian Gray is my dearest friend , "
5876	5965	5873	5873	he	1982	" He has a simple and a beautiful nature . Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him . Do n't spoil him . Do n't try to influence him . Your influence would be bad . The world is wide , and has many marvellous people in it . Do n't take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses : my life as an artist depends on him . Mind , Harry , I trust you . "
5984	5990	5992	5993	Lord Henry	112	" What nonsense you talk ! "
6043	6047	6020	6020	He	115	" Forest Scenes . "
6048	6057	6058	6058	he	115	" You must lend me these , Basil , "
6061	6073	6058	6058	he	115	" I want to learn them . They are perfectly charming . "
6074	6088	6028	6028	his	115	" That entirely depends on how you sit to - day , Dorian . "
6089	6111	6113	6114	the lad	405	" Oh , I am tired of sitting , and I do n't want a life - sized portrait of myself , "
6153	6173	6149	6149	he	115	" I beg your pardon , Basil , but I did n't know you had any one with you . "
6174	6210	6282	6282	Dorian	115	" This is Lord Henry Wotton , Dorian , an old Oxford friend of mine . I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were , and now you have spoiled everything . "
6211	6225	6227	6228	Lord Henry	112	" You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you , Mr. Gray , "
6237	6267	6227	6228	Lord Henry	112	" My aunt has often spoken to me about you . You are one of her favourites , and , I am afraid , one of her victims also . "
6268	6280	6282	6282	Dorian	115	" I am in Lady Agatha 's black books at present , "
6290	6347	6282	6282	Dorian	115	" I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday , and I really forgot all about it . We were to have played a duet together - three duets , I believe . I do n't know what she will say to me . I am far too frightened to call . "
6348	6408	6430	6431	Lord Henry	112	" Oh , I will make your peace with my aunt . She is quite devoted to you . And I do n't think it really matters about your not being there . The audience probably thought it was a duet . When Aunt Agatha sits down to the piano , she makes quite enough noise for two people . "
6409	6424	6426	6426	Dorian	115	" That is very horrid to her , and not very nice to me , "
6511	6529	6531	6532	Lord Henry	112	" You are too charming to go in for philanthropy , Mr. Gray - far too charming . "
6589	6618	6575	6575	he	366	" Harry , I want to finish this picture to - day . Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away ? "
6628	6637	6638	6638	he	366	" Am I to go , Mr. Gray ? "
6641	6690	6575	6575	he	366	" Oh , please do n't , Lord Henry . I see that Basil is in one of his sulky moods , and I ca n't bear him when he sulks . Besides , I want you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy . "
6691	6768	6619	6620	Lord Henry	112	" I do n't know that I shall tell you that , Mr. Gray . It is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it . But I certainly shall not run away , now that you have asked me to stop . You do n't really mind , Basil , do you ? You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to . "
6774	6797	6771	6771	his	113	" If Dorian wishes it , of course you must stay . Dorian 's whims are laws to everybody , except himself . "
6807	6877	6798	6799	Lord Henry	112	" You are very pressing , Basil , but I am afraid I must go . I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans . Good - bye , Mr. Gray . Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street . I am nearly always at home at five o'clock . Write to me when you are coming . I should be sorry to miss you . "
6878	6881	6883	6884	Dorian Gray	115	" Basil , "
6886	6934	6883	6884	Dorian Gray	115	" if Lord Henry Wotton goes , I shall go , too . You never open your lips while you are painting , and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant . Ask him to stay . I insist upon it . "
6935	6949	6951	6951	Hallward	113	" Stay , Harry , to oblige Dorian , and to oblige me , "
6959	6995	6951	6951	Hallward	113	" It is quite true , I never talk when I am working , and never listen either , and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters . I beg you to stay . "
6996	7006	6883	6884	Dorian Gray	115	" But what about my man at the Orleans ? "
7011	7077	7007	7008	The painter	366	" I do n't think there will be any difficulty about that . Sit down again , Harry . And now , Dorian , get up on the platform , and do n't move about too much , or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says . He has a very bad influence over all his friends , with the single exception of myself . "
7145	7163	7140	7140	he	115	" Have you really a very bad influence , Lord Henry ? As bad as Basil says ? "
7164	7191	7140	7140	he	115	" There is no such thing as a good influence , Mr. Gray . All influence is immoral - immoral from the scientific point of view . "
7192	7195	7140	7140	he	115	" Why ? "
7196	7401	7140	7140	he	115	" Because to influence a person is to give him one 's own soul . He does not think his natural thoughts , or burn with his natural passions . His virtues are not real to him . His sins , if there are such things as sins , are borrowed . He becomes an echo of some one else 's music , an actor of a part that has not been written for him . The aim of life is self - development . To realize one 's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for . People are afraid of themselves , nowadays . They have forgotten the highest of all duties , the duty that one owes to one 's self . Of course , they are charitable . They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar . But their own souls starve , and are naked . Courage has gone out of our race . Perhaps we never really had it . The terror of society , which is the basis of morals , the terror of God , which is the secret of religion - these are the two things that govern us . And yet- "
7402	7421	7423	7424	the painter	366	" Just turn your head a little more to the right , Dorian , like a good boy , "
7451	7455	7461	7461	his	112	" And yet , "
7493	7801	7485	7485	he	112	" I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely , were to give form to every feeling , expression to every thought , reality to every dream - I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of medievalism , and return to the Hellenic ideal - to something finer , richer than the Hellenic ideal , it may be . But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself . The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self - denial that mars our lives . We are punished for our refusals . Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us . The body sins once , and has done with its sin , for action is a mode of purification . Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure , or the luxury of a regret . The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it . Resist it , and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself , with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful . It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain . It is in the brain , and the brain only , that the great sins of the world take place also . You , Mr. Gray , you yourself , with your rose - red youth and your rose - white boyhood , you have had passions that have made you afraid , thoughts that have filled you with terror , day - dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame- "
7802	7805	7807	7808	Dorian Gray	115	" Stop ! "
7810	7858	7807	7808	Dorian Gray	115	" stop ! you bewilder me . I do n't know what to say . There is some answer to you , but I can not find it . Do n't speak . Let me think . Or , rather , let me try not to think . "
8261	8270	8272	8273	Dorian Gray	115	" Basil , I am tired of standing , "
8276	8293	8272	8273	Dorian Gray	115	" I must go out and sit in the garden . The air is stifling here . "
8294	8393	8438	8438	his	112	" My dear fellow , I am so sorry . When I am painting , I ca n't think of anything else . But you never sat better . You were perfectly still . And I have caught the effect I wanted - the half - parted lips and the bright look in the eyes . I do n't know what Harry has been saying to you , but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression . I suppose he has been paying you compliments . You must n't believe a word that he says . "
8394	8420	8272	8273	Dorian Gray	115	" He has certainly not been paying me compliments . Perhaps that is the reason that I do n't believe anything he has told me . "
8421	8429	8431	8432	Lord Henry	112	" You know you believe it all , "
8443	8478	8431	8432	Lord Henry	112	" I will go out to the garden with you . It is horribly hot in the studio . Basil , let us have something iced to drink , something with strawberries in it . "
8479	8557	8592	8592	He	112	" Certainly , Harry . Just touch the bell , and when Parker comes I will tell him what you want . I have got to work up this background , so I will join you later on . Do n't keep Dorian too long . I have never been in better form for painting than I am to - day . This is going to be my masterpiece . It is my masterpiece as it stands . "
8605	8614	8615	8615	he	112	" You are quite right to do that , "
8618	8639	8615	8615	he	112	" Nothing can cure the soul but the senses , just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul . "
8707	8710	8712	8713	Lord Henry	112	" Yes , "
8715	8771	8712	8713	Lord Henry	112	" that is one of the great secrets of life - to cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul . You are a wonderful creation . You know more than you think you know , just as you know less than you want to know . "
8952	8962	8964	8965	Lord Henry	112	" Let us go and sit in the shade , "
8967	9014	8964	8965	Lord Henry	112	" Parker has brought out the drinks , and if you stay any longer in this glare , you will be quite spoiled , and Basil will never paint you again . You really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt . It would be unbecoming . "
9015	9021	9023	9024	Dorian Gray	115	" What can it matter ? "
9042	9053	8964	8965	Lord Henry	112	" It should matter everything to you , Mr. Gray . "
9054	9057	8964	8965	Lord Henry	112	" Why ? "
9058	9076	8964	8965	Lord Henry	112	" Because you have the most marvellous youth , and youth is the one thing worth having . "
9077	9087	8964	8965	Lord Henry	112	" I do n't feel that , Lord Henry . "
9088	9802	8964	8965	Lord Henry	112	" No , you do n't feel it now . Some day , when you are old and wrinkled and ugly , when thought has seared your forehead with its lines , and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires , you will feel it , you will feel it terribly . Now , wherever you go , you charm the world . Will it always be so ? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face , Mr. Gray . Do n't frown . You have . And beauty is a form of genius - is higher , indeed , than genius , as it needs no explanation . It is of the great facts of the world , like sunlight , or spring - time , or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon . It can not be questioned . It has its divine right of sovereignty . It makes princes of those who have it . You smile ? Ah ! when you have lost it you wo n't smile .... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial . That may be so , but at least it is not so superficial as thought is . To me , beauty is the wonder of wonders . It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances . The true mystery of the world is the visible , not the invisible .... Yes , Mr. Gray , the gods have been good to you . But what the gods give they quickly take away . You have only a few years in which to live really , perfectly , and fully . When your youth goes , your beauty will go with it , and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you , or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats . Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful . Time is jealous of you , and wars against your lilies and your roses . You will become sallow , and hollow - cheeked , and dull - eyed . You will suffer horribly .... Ah ! realize your youth while you have it . Do n't squander the gold of your days , listening to the tedious , trying to improve the hopeless failure , or giving away your life to the ignorant , the common , and the vulgar . These are the sickly aims , the false ideals , of our age . Live ! Live the wonderful life that is in you ! Let nothing be lost upon you . Be always searching for new sensations . Be afraid of nothing .... A new Hedonism - that is what our century wants . You might be its visible symbol . With your personality there is nothing you could not do . The world belongs to you for a season .... The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are , of what you really might be . There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself . I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted . For there is such a little time that your youth will last - such a little time . The common hill - flowers wither , but they blossom again . The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now . In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis , and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars . But we never get back our youth . The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish . Our limbs fail , our senses rot . We degenerate into hideous puppets , haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid , and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to . Youth ! Youth ! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth ! "
9977	9982	9983	9983	he	366	" I am waiting , "
9986	10004	9983	9983	he	366	" Do come in . The light is quite perfect , and you can bring your drinks . "
10044	10056	10058	10059	Lord Henry	112	" You are glad you have met me , Mr. Gray , "
10065	10081	10058	10059	Lord Henry	112	" Yes , I am glad now . I wonder shall I always be glad ? "
10082	10148	10158	10158	his	115	" Always ! That is a dreadful word . It makes me shudder when I hear it . Women are so fond of using it . They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever . It is a meaningless word , too . The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer . "
10166	10178	10179	10179	he	115	" In that case , let our friendship be a caprice , "
10323	10329	10330	10330	he	113	" It is quite finished , "
10381	10392	10393	10393	he	112	" My dear fellow , I congratulate you most warmly , "
10396	10416	10393	10393	he	112	" It is the finest portrait of modern times . Mr. Gray , come over and look at yourself . "
10428	10434	10435	10435	he	112	" Is it really finished ? "
10444	10448	10450	10451	the painter	366	" Quite finished , "
10453	10470	10450	10451	the painter	366	" And you have sat splendidly to - day . I am awfully obliged to you . "
10471	10479	10482	10483	Lord Henry	112	" That is entirely due to me , "
10485	10493	10482	10483	Lord Henry	112	" Is n't it , Mr. Gray ? "
10813	10820	10822	10822	Hallward	113	" Do n't you like it ? "
10841	10848	10850	10851	Lord Henry	112	" Of course he likes it , "
10853	10888	10850	10851	Lord Henry	112	" Who would n't like it ? It is one of the greatest things in modern art . I will give you anything you like to ask for it . I must have it . "
10889	10898	10822	10822	Hallward	113	" It is not my property , Harry . "
10899	10905	10850	10851	Lord Henry	112	" Whose property is it ? "
10906	10913	10915	10916	the painter	366	" Dorian 's , of course , "
10918	10926	10850	10851	Lord Henry	112	" He is a very lucky fellow . "
10927	10933	10935	10936	Dorian Gray	115	" How sad it is ! "
10947	11045	10935	10936	Dorian Gray	115	" How sad it is ! I shall grow old , and horrible , and dreadful . But this picture will remain always young . It will never be older than this particular day of June .... If it were only the other way ! If it were I who was to be always young , and the picture that was to grow old ! For that - for that - I would give everything ! Yes , there is nothing in the whole world I would not give ! I would give my soul for that ! "
11046	11058	11060	11061	Lord Henry	112	" You would hardly care for such an arrangement , Basil , "
11065	11076	11060	11061	Lord Henry	112	" It would be rather hard lines on your work . "
11077	11086	11088	11088	Hallward	113	" I should object very strongly , Harry , "
11098	11135	11090	11091	Dorian Gray	115	" I believe you would , Basil . You like your art better than your friends . I am no more to you than a green bronze figure . Hardly as much , I dare say . "
11170	11173	11174	11174	he	115	" Yes , "
11177	11274	11174	11174	he	115	" I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun . You will like them always . How long will you like me ? Till I have my first wrinkle , I suppose . I know , now , that when one loses one 's good looks , whatever they may be , one loses everything . Your picture has taught me that . Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right . Youth is the only thing worth having . When I find that I am growing old , I shall kill myself . "
11283	11288	11289	11289	he	113	" Dorian ! Dorian ! "
11292	11335	11289	11289	he	113	" do n't talk like that . I have never had such a friend as you , and I shall never have such another . You are not jealous of material things , are you?-you who are finer than any of them ! "
11336	11426	11472	11473	the painter	366	" I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die . I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me . Why should it keep what I must lose ? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it . Oh , if it were only the other way ! If the picture could change , and I could be always what I am now ! Why did you paint it ? It will mock me some day - mock me horribly ! "
11462	11470	11472	11473	the painter	366	" This is your doing , Harry , "
11482	11494	11479	11479	his	112	" It is the real Dorian Gray - that is all . "
11495	11500	11476	11477	Lord Henry	112	" It is not . "
11501	11515	11479	11479	his	112	" If it is not , what have I to do with it ? "
11516	11527	11528	11528	he	113	" You should have gone away when I asked you , "
11531	11539	11541	11542	Lord Henry	112	" I stayed when you asked me , "
11546	11608	11479	11479	his	112	" Harry , I ca n't quarrel with my two best friends at once , but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever done , and I will destroy it . What is it but canvas and colour ? I will not let it come across our three lives and mar them . "
11747	11756	11757	11757	he	115	" Do n't , Basil , do n't ! "
11760	11766	11757	11757	he	115	" It would be murder ! "
11767	11780	11782	11783	the painter	366	" I am glad you appreciate my work at last , Dorian , "
11793	11800	11782	11783	the painter	366	" I never thought you would . "
11801	11824	11757	11757	he	115	" Appreciate it ? I am in love with it , Basil . It is part of myself . I feel that . "
11825	11857	11859	11859	he	366	" Well , as soon as you are dry , you shall be varnished , and framed , and sent home . Then you can do what you like with yourself . "
11871	11898	11859	11859	he	366	" You will have tea , of course , Dorian ? And so will you , Harry ? Or do you object to such simple pleasures ? "
11899	11905	11907	11908	Lord Henry	112	" I adore simple pleasures , "
11910	12021	11907	11908	Lord Henry	112	" They are the last refuge of the complex . But I do n't like scenes , except on the stage . What absurd fellows you are , both of you ! I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal . It was the most premature definition ever given . Man is many things , but he is not rational . I am glad he is not , after all - though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture . You had much better let me have it , Basil . This silly boy does n't really want it , and I really do . "
12022	12041	12043	12044	Dorian Gray	115	" If you let any one have it but me , Basil , I shall never forgive you ! "
12046	12060	12043	12044	Dorian Gray	115	" and I do n't allow people to call me a silly boy . "
12061	12080	11859	11859	he	366	" You know the picture is yours , Dorian . I gave it to you before it existed . "
12081	12111	12043	12044	Dorian Gray	115	" And you know you have been a little silly , Mr. Gray , and that you do n't really object to being reminded that you are extremely young . "
12112	12125	11859	11859	he	366	" I should have objected very strongly this morning , Lord Henry . "
12126	12138	12043	12044	Dorian Gray	115	" Ah ! this morning ! You have lived since then . "
12223	12234	12236	12237	Lord Henry	112	" Let us go to the theatre to - night , "
12239	12315	12236	12237	Lord Henry	112	" There is sure to be something on , somewhere . I have promised to dine at White 's , but it is only with an old friend , so I can send him a wire to say that I am ill , or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement . I think that would be a rather nice excuse : it would have all the surprise of candour . "
12316	12330	12332	12332	Hallward	113	" It is such a bore putting on one 's dress - clothes , "
12334	12348	12332	12332	Hallward	113	" And , when one has them on , they are so horrid . "
12349	12352	12354	12355	Lord Henry	112	" Yes , "
12358	12389	12354	12355	Lord Henry	112	" the costume of the nineteenth century is detestable . It is so sombre , so depressing . Sin is the only real colour - element left in modern life . "
12390	12404	12236	12237	Lord Henry	112	" You really must not say things like that before Dorian , Harry . "
12405	12427	12354	12355	Lord Henry	112	" Before which Dorian ? The one who is pouring out tea for us , or the one in the picture ? "
12428	12432	12236	12237	Lord Henry	112	" Before either . "
12433	12448	12450	12451	the lad	405	" I should like to come to the theatre with you , Lord Henry , "
12453	12472	12236	12237	Lord Henry	112	" Then you shall come ; and you will come , too , Basil , wo n't you ? "
12473	12494	12236	12237	Lord Henry	112	" I ca n't , really . I would sooner not . I have a lot of work to do . "
12495	12510	12236	12237	Lord Henry	112	" Well , then , you and I will go alone , Mr. Gray . "
12511	12518	12236	12237	Lord Henry	112	" I should like that awfully . "
12536	12545	12546	12546	he	366	" I shall stay with the real Dorian , "
12551	12558	12560	12564	the original of the portrait	457	" Is it the real Dorian ? "
12571	12578	12560	12564	the original of the portrait	457	" Am I really like that ? "
12579	12588	12519	12520	The painter	366	" Yes ; you are just like that . "
12589	12595	12560	12564	the original of the portrait	457	" How wonderful , Basil ! "
12596	12612	12614	12614	Hallward	113	" At least you are like it in appearance . But it will never alter , "
12616	12621	12614	12614	Hallward	113	" That is something . "
12622	12631	12633	12634	Lord Henry	112	" What a fuss people make about fidelity ! "
12636	12689	12633	12634	Lord Henry	112	" Why , even in love it is purely a question for physiology . It has nothing to do with our own will . Young men want to be faithful , and are not ; old men want to be faithless , and can not : that is all one can say . "
12690	12703	12705	12705	Hallward	113	" Do n't go to the theatre to - night , Dorian , "
12707	12714	12705	12705	Hallward	113	" Stop and dine with me . "
12715	12722	12633	12634	Lord Henry	112	" I ca n't , Basil . "
12723	12726	12705	12705	Hallward	113	" Why ? "
12727	12740	12633	12634	Lord Henry	112	" Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him . "
12741	12767	12705	12705	Hallward	113	" He wo n't like you the better for keeping your promises . He always breaks his own . I beg you not to go . "
12776	12781	12773	12773	his	115	" I entreat you . "
12807	12814	12815	12815	he	112	" I must go , Basil , "
12818	12822	12824	12824	Hallward	113	" Very well , "
12839	12883	12827	12827	he	113	" It is rather late , and , as you have to dress , you had better lose no time . Good - bye , Harry . Good - bye , Dorian . Come and see me soon . Come to - morrow . "
12884	12887	12958	12959	Lord Henry	112	" Certainly . "
12888	12894	12827	12827	he	113	" You wo n't forget ? "
12895	12902	12904	12904	Dorian	115	" No , of course not , "
12906	12911	12827	12827	he	113	" And ... Harry ! "
12912	12917	12827	12827	he	113	" Yes , Basil ? "
12918	12934	12827	12827	he	113	" Remember what I asked you , when we were in the garden this morning . "
12935	12941	12827	12827	he	113	" I have forgotten it . "
12942	12947	12827	12827	he	113	" I trust you . "
12948	12956	12958	12959	Lord Henry	112	" I wish I could trust myself , "
12963	12998	12958	12959	Lord Henry	112	" Come , Mr. Gray , my hansom is outside , and I can drop you at your own place . Good - bye , Basil . It has been a most interesting afternoon . "
13425	13430	13432	13434	the old gentleman	489	" Well , Harry , "
13436	13461	13432	13434	the old gentleman	489	" what brings you out so early ? I thought you dandies never got up till two , and were not visible till five . "
13462	13483	13432	13434	the old gentleman	489	" Pure family affection , I assure you , Uncle George . I want to get something out of you . "
13484	13490	13492	13493	Lord Fermor	134	" Money , I suppose , "
13500	13523	13492	13493	Lord Fermor	134	" Well , sit down and tell me all about it . Young people , nowadays , imagine that money is everything . "
13524	13527	13529	13530	Lord Henry	112	" Yes , "
13541	13628	13529	13530	Lord Henry	112	" and when they grow older they know it . But I do n't want money . It is only people who pay their bills who want that , Uncle George , and I never pay mine . Credit is the capital of a younger son , and one lives charmingly upon it . Besides , I always deal with Dartmoor 's tradesmen , and consequently they never bother me . What I want is information : not useful information , of course ; useless information . "
13629	13725	13492	13493	Lord Fermor	134	" Well , I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book , Harry , although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense . When I was in the Diplomatic , things were much better . But I hear they let them in now by examination . What can you expect ? Examinations , sir , are pure humbug from beginning to end . If a man is a gentleman , he knows quite enough , and if he is not a gentleman , whatever he knows is bad for him . "
13726	13740	13742	13743	Lord Henry	112	" Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books , Uncle George , "
13746	13755	13757	13758	Lord Fermor	134	" Mr. Dorian Gray ? Who is he ? "
13766	13861	13492	13493	Lord Fermor	134	" That is what I have come to learn , Uncle George . Or rather , I know who he is . He is the last Lord Kelso 's grandson . His mother was a Devereux , Lady Margaret Devereux . I want you to tell me about his mother . What was she like ? Whom did she marry ? You have known nearly everybody in your time , so you might have known her . I am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present . I have only just met him . "
13862	13867	13869	13871	the old gentleman	489	" Kelso 's grandson ! "
13873	14129	13869	13871	the old gentleman	489	" Kelso 's grandson ! ... Of course .... I knew his mother intimately . I believe I was at her christening . She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl , Margaret Devereux , and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow - a mere nobody , sir , a subaltern in a foot regiment , or something of that kind . Certainly . I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday . The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage . There was an ugly story about it . They said Kelso got some rascally adventurer , some Belgian brute , to insult his son - in - law in public - paid him , sir , to do it , paid him - and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon . The thing was hushed up , but , egad , Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards . He brought his daughter back with him , I was told , and she never spoke to him again . Oh , yes ; it was a bad business . The girl died , too , died within a year . So she left a son , did she ? I had forgotten that . What sort of boy is he ? If he is like his mother , he must be a good - looking chap . "
14130	14138	14140	14141	Lord Henry	112	" He is very good - looking , "
14143	14153	14155	14157	the old man	491	" I hope he will fall into proper hands , "
14159	14286	14155	14157	the old man	491	" He should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing by him . His mother had money , too . All the Selby property came to her , through her grandfather . Her grandfather hated Kelso , thought him a mean dog . He was , too . Came to Madrid once when I was there . Egad , I was ashamed of him . The Queen used to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares . They made quite a story of it . I did n't dare show my face at Court for a month . I hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies . "
14287	14293	14295	14296	Lord Henry	112	" I do n't know , "
14298	14336	14295	14296	Lord Henry	112	" I fancy that the boy will be well off . He is not of age yet . He has Selby , I know . He told me so . And ... his mother was very beautiful ? "
14337	14484	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw , Harry . What on earth induced her to behave as she did , I never could understand . She could have married anybody she chose . Carlington was mad after her . She was romantic , though . All the women of that family were . The men were a poor lot , but , egad ! the women were wonderful . Carlington went on his knees to her . Told me so himself . She laughed at him , and there was n't a girl in London at the time who was n't after him . And by the way , Harry , talking about silly marriages , what is this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American ? Ai n't English girls good enough for him ? "
14485	14499	14295	14296	Lord Henry	112	" It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now , Uncle George . "
14500	14512	14514	14515	Lord Fermor	134	" I 'll back English women against the world , Harry , "
14524	14532	14521	14521	his	134	" The betting is on the Americans . "
14533	14543	14545	14546	his uncle	463	" They do n't last , I am told , "
14548	14577	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" A long engagement exhausts them , but they are capital at a steeplechase . They take things flying . I do n't think Dartmoor has a chance . "
14578	14584	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" Who are her people ? "
14590	14596	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" Has she got any ? "
14603	14623	14624	14624	he	112	" American girls are as clever at concealing their parents , as English women are at concealing their past , "
14631	14641	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" They are pork - packers , I suppose ? "
14642	14673	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" I hope so , Uncle George , for Dartmoor 's sake . I am told that pork - packing is the most lucrative profession in America , after politics . "
14674	14679	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" Is she pretty ? "
14680	14702	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" She behaves as if she was beautiful . Most American women do . It is the secret of their charm . "
14703	14729	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" Why ca n't these American women stay in their own country ? They are always telling us that it is the paradise for women . "
14730	14754	14756	14757	Lord Henry	112	" It is . That is the reason why , like Eve , they are so excessively anxious to get out of it , "
14759	14807	14756	14757	Lord Henry	112	" Good - bye , Uncle George . I shall be late for lunch , if I stop any longer . Thanks for giving me the information I wanted . I always like to know everything about my new friends , and nothing about my old ones . "
14808	14816	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" Where are you lunching , Harry ? "
14817	14839	14756	14757	Lord Henry	112	" At Aunt Agatha 's . I have asked myself and Mr. Gray . He is her latest _ protege _ . "
14840	14888	14586	14588	the old gentleman	489	" Humph ! tell your Aunt Agatha , Harry , not to bother me any more with her charity appeals . I am sick of them . Why , the good woman thinks that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads . "
14889	14923	14756	14757	Lord Henry	112	" All right , Uncle George , I 'll tell her , but it wo n't have any effect . Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity . It is their distinguishing characteristic . "
15713	15720	15726	15726	her	388	" Late as usual , Harry , "
16046	16057	16059	16060	the duchess	547	" We are talking about poor Dartmoor , Lord Henry , "
16070	16083	16059	16060	the duchess	547	" Do you think he will really marry this fascinating young person ? "
16084	16100	16059	16060	the duchess	547	" I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him , Duchess . "
16101	16105	16107	16108	Lady Agatha	126	" How dreadful ! "
16110	16118	16107	16108	Lady Agatha	126	" Really , some one should interfere . "
16119	16139	16141	16143	Sir Thomas Burdon	149	" I am told , on excellent authority , that her father keeps an American dry - goods store , "
16148	16161	16107	16108	Lady Agatha	126	" My uncle has already suggested pork - packing , Sir Thomas . "
16162	16174	16176	16177	the duchess	547	" Dry - goods ! What are American dry - goods ? "
16190	16194	16196	16197	Lord Henry	112	" American novels , "
16210	16219	16221	16222	Lady Agatha	126	" Do n't mind him , my dear , "
16224	16233	16221	16222	Lady Agatha	126	" He never means anything that he says . "
16234	16240	16242	16244	the Radical member	550	" When America was discovered , "
16280	16293	16294	16294	she	547	" I wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all ! "
16297	16312	16294	16294	she	547	" Really , our girls have no chance nowadays . It is most unfair . "
16313	16325	16327	16328	Mr. Erskine	150	" Perhaps , after all , America never has been discovered , "
16330	16342	16327	16328	Mr. Erskine	150	" I myself would say that it had merely been detected . "
16343	16355	16357	16358	the duchess	547	" Oh ! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants , "
16361	16398	16357	16358	the duchess	547	" I must confess that most of them are extremely pretty . And they dress well , too . They get all their dresses in Paris . I wish I could afford to do the same . "
16399	16412	16414	16415	Sir Thomas	149	" They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris , "
16430	16444	16446	16447	the duchess	547	" Really ! And where do bad Americans go to when they die ? "
16449	16455	16457	16458	Lord Henry	112	" They go to America , "
16464	16478	16479	16479	he	149	" I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country , "
16485	16521	16479	16479	he	149	" I have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors , who , in such matters , are extremely civil . I assure you that it is an education to visit it . "
16522	16535	16537	16538	Mr. Erskine	150	" But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated ? "
16541	16551	16537	16538	Mr. Erskine	150	" I do n't feel up to the journey . "
16558	16626	16552	16553	Sir Thomas	149	" Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on his shelves . We practical men like to see things , not to read about them . The Americans are an extremely interesting people . They are absolutely reasonable . I think that is their distinguishing characteristic . Yes , Mr. Erskine , an absolutely reasonable people . I assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans . "
16627	16631	16633	16634	Lord Henry	112	" How dreadful ! "
16636	16665	16633	16634	Lord Henry	112	" I can stand brute force , but brute reason is quite unbearable . There is something unfair about its use . It is hitting below the intellect . "
16666	16673	16675	16676	Sir Thomas	149	" I do not understand you , "
16682	16689	16691	16692	Mr. Erskine	150	" I do , Lord Henry , "
16698	16708	16710	16711	the baronet	556	" Paradoxes are all very well in their way .... "
16713	16719	16721	16722	Mr. Erskine	150	" Was that a paradox ? "
16724	16770	16721	16722	Mr. Erskine	150	" I did not think so . Perhaps it was . Well , the way of paradoxes is the way of truth . To test reality we must see it on the tight rope . When the verities become acrobats , we can judge them . "
16771	16775	16777	16778	Lady Agatha	126	" Dear me ! "
16780	16844	16777	16778	Lady Agatha	126	" how you men argue ! I am sure I never can make out what you are talking about . Oh ! Harry , I am quite vexed with you . Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East End ? I assure you he would be quite invaluable . They would love his playing . "
16845	16854	16856	16857	Lord Henry	112	" I want him to play to me , "
16874	16883	16885	16886	Lady Agatha	126	" But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel , "
16888	16897	16899	16900	Lord Henry	112	" I can sympathize with everything except suffering , "
16906	16963	16899	16900	Lord Henry	112	" I can not sympathize with that . It is too ugly , too horrible , too distressing . There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain . One should sympathize with the colour , the beauty , the joy of life . The less said about life 's sores , the better . "
16964	16976	16978	16979	Sir Thomas	149	" Still , the East End is a very important problem , "
16988	16992	16994	16996	the young lord	379	" Quite so , "
16998	17017	16994	16996	the young lord	379	" It is the problem of slavery , and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves . "
17025	17034	17035	17035	he	558	" What change do you propose , then ? "
17042	17056	17057	17057	he	558	" I do n't desire to change anything in England except the weather , "
17060	17124	17057	17057	he	558	" I am quite content with philosophic contemplation . But , as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over - expenditure of sympathy , I would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight . The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray , and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional . "
17125	17133	17135	17136	Mrs. Vandeleur	151	" But we have such grave responsibilities , "
17139	17143	17145	17146	Lady Agatha	126	" Terribly grave , "
17156	17186	17153	17154	Mr. Erskine	150	" Humanity takes itself too seriously . It is the world 's original sin . If the caveman had known how to laugh , history would have been different . "
17187	17194	17196	17197	the duchess	547	" You are really very comforting , "
17199	17244	17196	17197	the duchess	547	" I have always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt , for I take no interest at all in the East End . For the future I shall be able to look her in the face without a blush . "
17245	17254	17256	17257	Lord Henry	112	" A blush is very becoming , Duchess , "
17259	17266	17267	17267	she	547	" Only when one is young , "
17270	17303	17267	17267	she	547	" When an old woman like myself blushes , it is a very bad sign . Ah ! Lord Henry , I wish you would tell me how to become young again . "
17310	17327	17328	17328	he	112	" Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days , Duchess ? "
17338	17346	17347	17347	she	547	" A great many , I fear , "
17350	17357	17358	17358	he	112	" Then commit them over again , "
17362	17379	17358	17358	he	112	" To get back one 's youth , one has merely to repeat one 's follies . "
17380	17385	17386	17386	she	547	" A delightful theory ! "
17389	17397	17386	17386	she	547	" I must put it into practice . "
17398	17403	17358	17358	he	112	" A dangerous theory ! "
17429	17432	17433	17433	he	150	" Yes , "
17436	17478	17433	17433	he	150	" that is one of the great secrets of life . Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense , and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one 's mistakes . "
17786	17790	17791	17791	she	547	" How annoying ! "
17794	17922	17791	17791	she	547	" I must go . I have to call for my husband at the club , to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis 's Rooms , where he is going to be in the chair . If I am late he is sure to be furious , and I could n't have a scene in this bonnet . It is far too fragile . A harsh word would ruin it . No , I must go , dear Agatha . Good - bye , Lord Henry , you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing . I am sure I do n't know what to say about your views . You must come and dine with us some night . Tuesday ? Are you disengaged Tuesday ? "
17923	17934	17936	17937	Lord Henry	112	" For you I would throw over anybody , Duchess , "
17942	17956	17957	17957	she	569	" Ah ! that is very nice , and very wrong of you , "
17960	17965	17968	17968	she	569	" so mind you come "
18012	18018	18019	18019	he	150	" You talk books away , "
18022	18030	18019	18019	he	150	" why do n't you write one ? "
18031	18108	17992	17993	Mr. Erskine	150	" I am too fond of reading books to care to write them , Mr. Erskine . I should like to write a novel certainly , a novel that would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal . But there is no literary public in England for anything except newspapers , primers , and encyclopaedias . Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature . "
18109	18116	18118	18119	Mr. Erskine	150	" I fear you are right , "
18121	18172	18118	18119	Mr. Erskine	150	" I myself used to have literary ambitions , but I gave them up long ago . And now , my dear young friend , if you will allow me to call you so , may I ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch ? "
18173	18181	18183	18184	Lord Henry	112	" I quite forget what I said , "
18186	18193	18183	18184	Lord Henry	112	" Was it all very bad ? "
18194	18281	17992	17993	Mr. Erskine	150	" Very bad indeed . In fact I consider you extremely dangerous , and if anything happens to our good duchess , we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible . But I should like to talk to you about life . The generation into which I was born was tedious . Some day , when you are tired of London , come down to Treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate enough to possess . "
18282	18309	18183	18184	Lord Henry	112	" I shall be charmed . A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege . It has a perfect host , and a perfect library . "
18310	18316	18318	18320	the old gentleman	489	" You will complete it , "
18326	18356	18318	18320	the old gentleman	489	" And now I must bid good - bye to your excellent aunt . I am due at the Athenaeum . It is the hour when we sleep there . "
18357	18365	18183	18184	Lord Henry	112	" All of you , Mr. Erskine ? "
18366	18387	18318	18320	the old gentleman	489	" Forty of us , in forty arm - chairs . We are practising for an English Academy of Letters . "
18394	18402	18403	18403	he	112	" I am going to the park , "
18423	18430	18431	18431	he	115	" Let me come with you , "
18434	18449	18451	18452	Lord Henry	112	" But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him , "
18454	18497	18451	18452	Lord Henry	112	" I would sooner come with you ; yes , I feel I must come with you . Do let me . And you will promise to talk to me all the time ? No one talks so wonderfully as you do . "
18498	18511	18513	18514	Lord Henry	112	" Ah ! I have talked quite enough for to - day , "
18518	18544	18513	18514	Lord Henry	112	" All I want now is to look at life . You may come and look at it with me , if you care to . "
18802	18810	18811	18811	he	405	" How late you are , Harry ! "
18814	18826	18925	18925	she	577	" I am afraid it is not Harry , Mr. Gray , "
18842	18850	18832	18832	He	405	" I beg your pardon . I thought- "
18851	18891	18925	18925	she	577	" You thought it was my husband . It is only his wife . You must let me introduce myself . I know you quite well by your photographs . I think my husband has got seventeen of them . "
18892	18899	18832	18832	He	405	" Not seventeen , Lady Henry ? "
18900	18920	18921	18921	She	577	" Well , eighteen , then . And I saw you with him the other night at the opera . "
19020	19032	19010	19010	she	577	" That was at Lohengrin , Lady Henry , I think ? "
19033	19086	19094	19094	her	577	" Yes ; it was at dear Lohengrin . I like Wagner 's music better than anybody 's . It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says . That is a great advantage , do n't you think so , Mr. Gray ? "
19121	19164	19118	19118	his	115	" I am afraid I do n't think so , Lady Henry . I never talk during music - at least , during good music . If one hears bad music , it is one 's duty to drown it in conversation . "
19165	19436	19094	19094	her	577	" Ah ! that is one of Harry 's views , is n't it , Mr. Gray ? I always hear Harry 's views from his friends . It is the only way I get to know of them . But you must not think I do n't like good music . I adore it , but I am afraid of it . It makes me too romantic . I have simply worshipped pianists - two at a time , sometimes , Harry tells me . I do n't know what it is about them . Perhaps it is that they are foreigners . They all are , ai n't they ? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after a time , do n't they ? It is so clever of them , and such a compliment to art . Makes it quite cosmopolitan , does n't it ? You have never been to any of my parties , have you , Mr. Gray ? You must come . I ca n't afford orchids , but I spare no expense in foreigners . They make one 's rooms look so picturesque . But here is Harry ! Harry , I came in to look for you , to ask you something - I forget what it was - and I found Mr. Gray here . We have had such a pleasant chat about music . We have quite the same ideas . No ; I think our ideas are quite different . But he has been most pleasant . I am so glad I 've seen him . "
19437	19448	19450	19451	Lord Henry	112	" I am charmed , my love , quite charmed , "
19471	19515	19450	19451	Lord Henry	112	" So sorry I am late , Dorian . I went to look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it . Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing . "
19516	19525	19527	19528	Lady Henry	162	" I am afraid I must be going , "
19540	19584	19535	19535	her	162	" I have promised to drive with the duchess . Good - bye , Mr. Gray . Good - bye , Harry . You are dining out , I suppose ? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury 's . "
19585	19593	19595	19596	Lord Henry	112	" I dare say , my dear , "
19648	19661	19662	19662	he	112	" Never marry a woman with straw - coloured hair , Dorian , "
19669	19674	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" Why , Harry ? "
19675	19682	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" Because they are so sentimental . "
19683	19690	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" But I like sentimental people . "
19691	19717	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" Never marry at all , Dorian . Men marry because they are tired ; women , because they are curious : both are disappointed . "
19718	19760	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" I do n't think I am likely to marry , Harry . I am too much in love . That is one of your aphorisms . I am putting it into practice , as I do everything that you say . "
19761	19769	19771	19772	Lord Henry	112	" Who are you in love with ? "
19777	19782	19784	19785	Dorian Gray	115	" With an actress , "
19795	19805	19792	19792	his	112	" That is a rather commonplace _ debut _ . "
19806	19819	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" You would not say so if you saw her , Harry . "
19820	19825	19792	19792	his	112	" Who is she ? "
19826	19833	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" Her name is Sibyl Vane . "
19834	19840	19792	19792	his	112	" Never heard of her . "
19841	19858	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" No one has . People will some day , however . She is a genius . "
19859	19909	19792	19792	his	112	" My dear boy , no woman is a genius . Women are a decorative sex . They never have anything to say , but they say it charmingly . Women represent the triumph of matter over mind , just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals . "
19910	19917	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" Harry , how can you ? "
19918	20115	19792	19792	his	112	" My dear Dorian , it is quite true . I am analysing women at present , so I ought to know . The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was . I find that , ultimately , there are only two kinds of women , the plain and the coloured . The plain women are very useful . If you want to gain a reputation for respectability , you have merely to take them down to supper . The other women are very charming . They commit one mistake , however . They paint in order to try and look young . Our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly . _ Rouge _ and _ esprit _ used to go together . That is all over now . As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter , she is perfectly satisfied . As for conversation , there are only five women in London worth talking to , and two of these ca n't be admitted into decent society . However , tell me about your genius . How long have you known her ? "
20116	20126	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" Ah ! Harry , your views terrify me . "
20127	20139	19792	19792	his	112	" Never mind that . How long have you known her ? "
20140	20145	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" About three weeks . "
20146	20155	19792	19792	his	112	" And where did you come across her ? "
20156	20610	19789	19790	Lord Henry	112	" I will tell you , Harry , but you must n't be unsympathetic about it . After all , it never would have happened if I had not met you . You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life . For days after I met you , something seemed to throb in my veins . As I lounged in the park , or strolled down Piccadilly , I used to look at every one who passed me and wonder , with a mad curiosity , what sort of lives they led . Some of them fascinated me . Others filled me with terror . There was an exquisite poison in the air . I had a passion for sensations .... Well , one evening about seven o'clock , I determined to go out in search of some adventure . I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours , with its myriads of people , its sordid sinners , and its splendid sins , as you once phrased it , must have something in store for me . I fancied a thousand things . The mere danger gave me a sense of delight . I remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together , about the search for beauty being the real secret of life . I do n't know what I expected , but I went out and wandered eastward , soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares . About half - past eight I passed by an absurd little theatre , with great flaring gas - jets and gaudy play - bills . A hideous Jew , in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life , was standing at the entrance , smoking a vile cigar . He had greasy ringlets , and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt . ' Have a box , my Lord ? ' he said , when he saw me , and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility . There was something about him , Harry , that amused me . He was such a monster . You will laugh at me , I know , but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage - box . To the present day I ca n't make out why I did so ; and yet if I hadn't - my dear Harry , if I hadn't - I should have missed the greatest romance of my life . I see you are laughing . It is horrid of you ! "
20611	20715	19792	19792	his	112	" I am not laughing , Dorian ; at least I am not laughing at you . But you should not say the greatest romance of your life . You should say the first romance of your life . You will always be loved , and you will always be in love with love . A _ grande passion _ is the privilege of people who have nothing to do . That is the one use of the idle classes of a country . Do n't be afraid . There are exquisite things in store for you . This is merely the beginning . "
20716	20725	20727	20728	Dorian Gray	115	" Do you think my nature so shallow ? "
20731	20741	19792	19792	his	112	" No ; I think your nature so deep . "
20742	20748	19792	19792	his	112	" How do you mean ? "
20749	20867	19792	19792	his	112	" My dear boy , the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people . What they call their loyalty , and their fidelity , I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination . Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect - simply a confession of failure . Faithfulness ! I must analyse it some day . The passion for property is in it . There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up . But I do n't want to interrupt you . Go on with your story . "
20868	20983	19792	19792	his	112	" Well , I found myself seated in a horrid little private box , with a vulgar drop - scene staring me in the face . I looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house . It was a tawdry affair , all Cupids and cornucopias , like a third - rate wedding - cake . The gallery and pit were fairly full , but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty , and there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the dress - circle . Women went about with oranges and ginger - beer , and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on . "
20984	20999	19792	19792	his	112	" It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama . "
21000	21042	19792	19792	his	112	" Just like , I should fancy , and very depressing . I began to wonder what on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play - bill . What do you think the play was , Harry ? "
21043	21115	19792	19792	his	112	" I should think ' The Idiot Boy ' , or ' Dumb but Innocent ' . Our fathers used to like that sort of piece , I believe . The longer I live , Dorian , the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us . In art , as in politics , _ les grandperes ont toujours tort _ . "
21116	21815	19792	19792	his	112	" This play was good enough for us , Harry . It was Romeo and Juliet . I must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place . Still , I felt interested , in a sort of way . At any rate , I determined to wait for the first act . There was a dreadful orchestra , presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a cracked piano , that nearly drove me away , but at last the drop - scene was drawn up and the play began . Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman , with corked eyebrows , a husky tragedy voice , and a figure like a beer - barrel . Mercutio was almost as bad . He was played by the low - comedian , who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit . They were both as grotesque as the scenery , and that looked as if it had come out of a country - booth . But Juliet ! Harry , imagine a girl , hardly seventeen years of age , with a little , flowerlike face , a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark - brown hair , eyes that were violet wells of passion , lips that were like the petals of a rose . She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life . You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved , but that beauty , mere beauty , could fill your eyes with tears . I tell you , Harry , I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me . And her voice - I never heard such a voice . It was very low at first , with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one 's ear . Then it became a little louder , and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy . In the garden - scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing . There were moments , later on , when it had the wild passion of violins . You know how a voice can stir one . Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget . When I close my eyes , I hear them , and each of them says something different . I do n't know which to follow . Why should I not love her ? Harry , I do love her . She is everything to me in life . Night after night I go to see her play . One evening she is Rosalind , and the next evening she is Imogen . I have seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb , sucking the poison from her lover 's lips . I have watched her wandering through the forest of Arden , disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap . She has been mad , and has come into the presence of a guilty king , and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of . She has been innocent , and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat . I have seen her in every age and in every costume . Ordinary women never appeal to one 's imagination . They are limited to their century . No glamour ever transfigures them . One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets . One can always find them . There is no mystery in any of them . They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea - parties in the afternoon . They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner . They are quite obvious . But an actress ! How different an actress is ! Harry ! why did n't you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress ? "
21816	21828	19792	19792	his	112	" Because I have loved so many of them , Dorian . "
21829	21843	19792	19792	his	112	" Oh , yes , horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces . "
21844	21865	21867	21868	Lord Henry	112	" Do n't run down dyed hair and painted faces . There is an extraordinary charm in them , sometimes , "
21870	21883	19792	19792	his	112	" I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane . "
21884	21907	19792	19792	his	112	" You could not have helped telling me , Dorian . All through your life you will tell me everything you do . "
21908	21956	19792	19792	his	112	" Yes , Harry , I believe that is true . I can not help telling you things . You have a curious influence over me . If I ever did a crime , I would come and confess it to you . You would understand me . "
21957	22013	19792	19792	his	112	" People like you - the wilful sunbeams of life - don't commit crimes , Dorian . But I am much obliged for the compliment , all the same . And now tell me - reach me the matches , like a good boy - thanks - what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane ? "
22028	22036	22014	22015	Dorian Gray	115	" Harry ! Sibyl Vane is sacred ! "
22037	22051	22053	22054	Lord Henry	112	" It is only the sacred things that are worth touching , Dorian , "
22066	22127	22053	22054	Lord Henry	112	" But why should you be annoyed ? I suppose she will belong to you some day . When one is in love , one always begins by deceiving one 's self , and one always ends by deceiving others . That is what the world calls a romance . You know her , at any rate , I suppose ? "
22128	22231	22014	22015	Dorian Gray	115	" Of course I know her . On the first night I was at the theatre , the horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her . I was furious with him , and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona . I think , from his blank look of amazement , that he was under the impression that I had taken too much champagne , or something . "
22232	22238	22053	22054	Lord Henry	112	" I am not surprised . "
22239	22297	22014	22015	Dorian Gray	115	" Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers . I told him I never even read them . He seemed terribly disappointed at that , and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him , and that they were every one of them to be bought . "
22298	22332	22053	22054	Lord Henry	112	" I should not wonder if he was quite right there . But , on the other hand , judging from their appearance , most of them can not be at all expensive . "
22333	22346	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" Well , he seemed to think they were beyond his means , "
22350	22480	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" By this time , however , the lights were being put out in the theatre , and I had to go . He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly recommended . I declined . The next night , of course , I arrived at the place again . When he saw me , he made me a low bow and assured me that I was a munificent patron of art . He was a most offensive brute , though he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare . He told me once , with an air of pride , that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to ' The Bard , ' as he insisted on calling him . He seemed to think it a distinction . "
22481	22533	22053	22054	Lord Henry	112	" It was a distinction , my dear Dorian - a great distinction . Most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life . To have ruined one 's self over poetry is an honour . But when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane ? "
22534	22606	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" The third night . She had been playing Rosalind . I could not help going round . I had thrown her some flowers , and she had looked at me - at least I fancied that she had . The old Jew was persistent . He seemed determined to take me behind , so I consented . It was curious my not wanting to know her , was n't it ? "
22607	22616	22053	22054	Lord Henry	112	" No ; I do n't think so . "
22617	22624	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" My dear Harry , why ? "
22625	22643	22053	22054	Lord Henry	112	" I will tell you some other time . Now I want to know about the girl . "
22644	22780	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" Sibyl ? Oh , she was so shy and so gentle . There is something of a child about her . Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her what I thought of her performance , and she seemed quite unconscious of her power . I think we were both rather nervous . The old Jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom , making elaborate speeches about us both , while we stood looking at each other like children . He would insist on calling me ' My Lord , ' so I had to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind . She said quite simply to me , ' You look more like a prince . I must call you Prince Charming . ' "
22781	22796	22053	22054	Lord Henry	112	" Upon my word , Dorian , Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments . "
22797	22860	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" You do n't understand her , Harry . She regarded me merely as a person in a play . She knows nothing of life . She lives with her mother , a faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing - wrapper on the first night , and looks as if she had seen better days . "
22861	22871	22873	22874	Lord Henry	112	" I know that look . It depresses me , "
22880	22899	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" The Jew wanted to tell me her history , but I said it did not interest me . "
22900	22918	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" You were quite right . There is always something infinitely mean about other people 's tragedies . "
22919	22975	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" Sibyl is the only thing I care about . What is it to me where she came from ? From her little head to her little feet , she is absolutely and entirely divine . Every night of my life I go to see her act , and every night she is more marvellous . "
22976	23016	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" That is the reason , I suppose , that you never dine with me now . I thought you must have some curious romance on hand . You have ; but it is not quite what I expected . "
23017	23043	23045	23045	Dorian	115	" My dear Harry , we either lunch or sup together every day , and I have been to the opera with you several times , "
23054	23061	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" You always come dreadfully late . "
23062	23075	23076	23076	he	115	" Well , I ca n't help going to see Sibyl play , "
23079	23121	23076	23076	he	115	" even if it is only for a single act . I get hungry for her presence ; and when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body , I am filled with awe . "
23122	23138	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" You can dine with me to - night , Dorian , ca n't you ? "
23144	23152	23153	23153	he	115	" To - night she is Imogen , "
23156	23167	23139	23139	He	115	" and to - morrow night she will be Juliet . "
23168	23175	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" When is she Sibyl Vane ? "
23176	23179	23139	23139	He	115	" Never . "
23180	23185	22348	22348	Dorian	115	" I congratulate you . "
23186	23309	23139	23139	He	115	" How horrid you are ! She is all the great heroines of the world in one . She is more than an individual . You laugh , but I tell you she has genius . I love her , and I must make her love me . You , who know all the secrets of life , tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me ! I want to make Romeo jealous . I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad . I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness , to wake their ashes into pain . My God , Harry , how I worship her ! "
23404	23413	23415	23416	Lord Henry	112	" And what do you propose to do ? "
23420	23533	24126	24126	he	115	" I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act . I have not the slightest fear of the result . You are certain to acknowledge her genius . Then we must get her out of the Jew 's hands . She is bound to him for three years - at least for two years and eight months - from the present time . I shall have to pay him something , of course . When all that is settled , I shall take a West End theatre and bring her out properly . She will make the world as mad as she has made me . "
23534	23544	23415	23416	Lord Henry	112	" That would be impossible , my dear boy . "
23545	23590	24126	24126	he	115	" Yes , she will . She has not merely art , consummate art - instinct , in her , but she has personality also ; and you have often told me that it is personalities , not principles , that move the age . "
23591	23600	23415	23416	Lord Henry	112	" Well , what night shall we go ? "
23601	23626	24126	24126	he	115	" Let me see . To - day is Tuesday . Let us fix to - morrow . She plays Juliet to - morrow . "
23627	23643	23415	23416	Lord Henry	112	" All right . The Bristol at eight o'clock ; and I will get Basil . "
23644	23680	24126	24126	he	115	" Not eight , Harry , please . Half - past six . We must be there before the curtain rises . You must see her in the first act , where she meets Romeo . "
23681	23734	23415	23416	Lord Henry	112	" Half - past six ! What an hour ! It will be like having a meat - tea , or reading an English novel . It must be seven . No gentleman dines before seven . Shall you see Basil between this and then ? Or shall I write to him ? "
23735	23835	24126	24126	he	115	" Dear Basil ! I have not laid eyes on him for a week . It is rather horrid of me , as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame , specially designed by himself , and , though I am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am , I must admit that I delight in it . Perhaps you had better write to him . I do n't want to see him alone . He says things that annoy me . He gives me good advice . "
23840	23864	23836	23837	Lord Henry	112	" People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves . It is what I call the depth of generosity . "
23865	23902	23415	23416	Lord Henry	112	" Oh , Basil is the best of fellows , but he seems to me to be just a bit of a Philistine . Since I have known you , Harry , I have discovered that . "
23903	24053	23836	23837	Lord Henry	112	" Basil , my dear boy , puts everything that is charming in him into his work . The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices , his principles , and his common sense . The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists . Good artists exist simply in what they make , and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are . A great poet , a really great poet , is the most unpoetical of all creatures . But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating . The worse their rhymes are , the more picturesque they look . The mere fact of having published a book of second - rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible . He lives the poetry that he can not write . The others write the poetry that they dare not realize . "
24054	24064	24066	24067	Dorian Gray	115	" I wonder is that really so , Harry ? "
24090	24124	24066	24067	Dorian Gray	115	" It must be , if you say it . And now I am off . Imogen is waiting for me . Do n't forget about to - morrow . Good - bye . "
25372	25382	25384	25385	the girl	2162	" Mother , Mother , I am so happy ! "
25428	25434	25435	25435	she	166	" I am so happy ! "
25438	25447	25435	25435	she	166	" and you must be happy , too ! "
25466	25469	25470	25470	she	181	" Happy ! "
25473	25512	25470	25470	she	181	" I am only happy , Sibyl , when I see you act . You must not think of anything but your acting . Mr. Isaacs has been very good to us , and we owe him money . "
25520	25525	25526	25526	she	2162	" Money , Mother ? "
25529	25541	25526	25526	she	2162	" what does money matter ? Love is more than money . "
25542	25587	25470	25470	she	181	" Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get a proper outfit for James . You must not forget that , Sibyl . Fifty pounds is a very large sum . Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate . "
25588	25607	25609	25610	the girl	2162	" He is not a gentleman , Mother , and I hate the way he talks to me , "
25623	25635	25637	25639	the elder woman	629	" I do n't know how we could manage without him , "
25650	25669	25645	25645	her	166	" We do n't want him any more , Mother . Prince Charming rules life for us now . "
25714	25719	25720	25720	she	166	" I love him , "
25724	25731	25756	25757	The girl	2162	" Foolish child ! foolish child ! "
25980	25985	25986	25986	she	2162	" Mother , Mother , "
25989	26077	25986	25986	she	2162	" why does he love me so much ? I know why I love him . I love him because he is like what love himself should be . But what does he see in me ? I am not worthy of him . And yet - why , I can not tell - though I feel so much beneath him , I do n't feel humble . I feel proud , terribly proud . Mother , did you love my father as I love Prince Charming ? "
26119	26177	26109	26109	her	166	" Forgive me , Mother . I know it pains you to talk about our father . But it only pains you because you loved him so much . Do n't look so sad . I am as happy to - day as you were twenty years ago . Ah ! let me be happy for ever ! "
26178	26263	26277	26278	Mrs. Vane	181	" My child , you are far too young to think of falling in love . Besides , what do you know of this young man ? You do n't even know his name . The whole thing is most inconvenient , and really , when James is going away to Australia , and I have so much to think of , I must say that you should have shown more consideration . However , as I said before , if he is rich ... "
26264	26276	26109	26109	her	166	" Ah ! Mother , Mother , let me be happy ! "
26411	26427	26429	26430	the lad	405	" You might keep some of your kisses for me , Sibyl , I think , "
26438	26451	26452	26452	she	181	" Ah ! but you do n't like being kissed , Jim , "
26455	26463	26452	26452	she	181	" You are a dreadful old bear . "
26485	26522	26474	26475	James Vane	183	" I want you to come out with me for a walk , Sibyl . I do n't suppose I shall ever see this horrid London again . I am sure I do n't want to . "
26523	26534	26536	26537	Mrs. Vane	181	" My son , do n't say such dreadful things , "
26580	26590	26474	26475	James Vane	183	" Why not , Mother ? I mean it . "
26591	26650	26474	26475	James Vane	183	" You pain me , my son . I trust you will return from Australia in a position of affluence . I believe there is no society of any kind in the Colonies - nothing that I would call society - so when you have made your fortune , you must come back and assert yourself in London . "
26651	26654	26656	26657	the lad	405	" Society ! "
26659	26690	26656	26657	the lad	405	" I do n't want to know anything about that . I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage . I hate it . "
26691	26696	26698	26698	Sibyl	166	" Oh , Jim ! "
26702	26791	26698	26698	Sibyl	166	" how unkind of you ! But are you really going for a walk with me ? That will be nice ! I was afraid you were going to say good - bye to some of your friends - to Tom Hardy , who gave you that hideous pipe , or Ned Langton , who makes fun of you for smoking it . It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon . Where shall we go ? Let us go to the park . "
26792	26798	26799	26799	he	650	" I am too shabby , "
26804	26813	26799	26799	he	650	" Only swell people go to the park . "
26814	26819	26820	26820	she	651	" Nonsense , Jim , "
26836	26840	26841	26841	he	650	" Very well , "
26846	26855	26841	26841	he	650	" but do n't be too long dressing . "
26902	26910	26911	26911	he	650	" Mother , are my things ready ? "
26914	26920	26921	26921	she	651	" Quite ready , James , "
27009	27026	27027	27027	she	651	" I hope you will be contented , James , with your sea - faring life , "
27030	27068	27027	27027	she	651	" You must remember that it is your own choice . You might have entered a solicitor 's office . Solicitors are a very respectable class , and in the country often dine with the best families . "
27069	27079	27080	27080	he	659	" I hate offices , and I hate clerks , "
27083	27123	27080	27080	he	659	" But you are quite right . I have chosen my own life . All I say is , watch over Sibyl . Do n't let her come to any harm . Mother , you must watch over her . "
27124	27140	27027	27027	she	651	" James , you really talk very strangely . Of course I watch over Sibyl . "
27141	27168	27080	27080	he	659	" I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to talk to her . Is that right ? What about that ? "
27169	27277	27027	27027	she	651	" You are speaking about things you do n't understand , James . In the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention . I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time . That was when acting was really understood . As for Sibyl , I do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not . But there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman . He is always most polite to me . Besides , he has the appearance of being rich , and the flowers he sends are lovely . "
27278	27288	27290	27291	the lad	405	" You do n't know his name , though , "
27294	27297	27306	27306	her	2139	" No , "
27309	27337	27306	27306	her	2139	" He has not yet revealed his real name . I think it is quite romantic of him . He is probably a member of the aristocracy . "
27344	27351	27352	27352	he	183	" Watch over Sibyl , Mother , "
27355	27360	27352	27352	he	183	" watch over her . "
27361	27452	27453	27454	The lad	405	" My son , you distress me very much . Sibyl is always under my special care . Of course , if this gentleman is wealthy , there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him . I trust he is one of the aristocracy . He has all the appearance of it , I must say . It might be a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl . They would make a charming couple . His good looks are really quite remarkable ; everybody notices them . "
27488	27495	27496	27496	she	166	" How serious you both are ! "
27499	27505	27496	27496	she	166	" What is the matter ? "
27506	27509	27510	27510	he	405	" Nothing , "
27513	27551	27510	27510	he	405	" I suppose one must be serious sometimes . Good - bye , Mother ; I will have my dinner at five o'clock . Everything is packed , except my shirts , so you need not trouble . "
27552	27560	27561	27561	she	166	" Good - bye , my son , "
27597	27603	27605	27606	the girl	2162	" Kiss me , Mother , "
27620	27627	27629	27630	Mrs. Vane	181	" My child ! my child ! "
27644	27649	27655	27655	He	664	" Come , Sibyl , "
28508	28522	28524	28524	Sibyl	166	" You are not listening to a word I am saying , Jim , "
28526	28543	28524	28524	Sibyl	166	" and I am making the most delightful plans for your future . Do say something . "
28544	28553	28600	28600	She	166	" What do you want me to say ? "
28554	28569	28570	28570	she	166	" Oh ! that you will be a good boy and not forget us , "
28582	28599	28577	28577	He	183	" You are more likely to forget me than I am to forget you , Sibyl . "
28603	28611	28612	28612	she	166	" What do you mean , Jim ? "
28615	28644	28577	28577	He	183	" You have a new friend , I hear . Who is he ? Why have you not told me about him ? He means you no good . "
28645	28650	28651	28651	she	166	" Stop , Jim ! "
28654	28667	28651	28651	she	166	" You must not say anything against him . I love him . "
28668	28679	28681	28682	the lad	405	" Why , you do n't even know his name , "
28684	28696	28681	28682	the lad	405	" Who is he ? I have a right to know . "
28697	28980	28651	28651	she	166	" He is called Prince Charming . Do n't you like the name . Oh ! you silly boy ! you should never forget it . If you only saw him , you would think him the most wonderful person in the world . Some day you will meet him - when you come back from Australia . You will like him so much . Everybody likes him , and I ... love him . I wish you could come to the theatre to - night . He is going to be there , and I am to play Juliet . Oh ! how I shall play it ! Fancy , Jim , to be in love and play Juliet ! To have him sitting there ! To play for his delight ! I am afraid I may frighten the company , frighten or enthrall them . To be in love is to surpass one 's self . Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting ' genius ' to his loafers at the bar . He has preached me as a dogma ; to - night he will announce me as a revelation . I feel it . And it is all his , his only , Prince Charming , my wonderful lover , my god of graces . But I am poor beside him . Poor ? What does that matter ? When poverty creeps in at the door , love flies in through the window . Our proverbs want rewriting . They were made in winter , and it is summer now ; spring - time for me , I think , a very dance of blossoms in blue skies . "
28981	28987	28989	28990	the lad	405	" He is a gentleman , "
28993	28997	28998	28998	she	710	" A prince ! "
29002	29009	28998	28998	she	710	" What more do you want ? "
29010	29017	28651	28651	she	166	" He wants to enslave you . "
29018	29028	28998	28998	she	710	" I shudder at the thought of being free . "
29029	29038	28651	28651	she	166	" I want you to beware of him . "
29039	29056	28998	28998	she	710	" To see him is to worship him ; to know him is to trust him . "
29057	29066	28651	28651	she	166	" Sibyl , you are mad about him . "
29074	29189	29067	29067	She	710	" You dear old Jim , you talk as if you were a hundred . Some day you will be in love yourself . Then you will know what it is . Do n't look so sulky . Surely you should be glad to think that , though you are going away , you leave me happier than I have ever been before . Life has been hard for us both , terribly hard and difficult . But it will be different now . You are going to a new world , and I have found one . Here are two chairs ; let us sit down and see the smart people go by . "
29343	29348	29349	29349	she	166	" There he is ! "
29352	29355	29357	29358	Jim Vane	183	" Who ? "
29360	29364	29365	29365	she	166	" Prince Charming , "
29384	29403	29404	29404	he	664	" Show him to me . Which is he ? Point him out . I must see him ! "
29442	29447	29449	29449	Sibyl	166	" He is gone , "
29452	29460	29449	29449	Sibyl	166	" I wish you had seen him . "
29461	29491	29501	29501	his	664	" I wish I had , for as sure as there is a God in heaven , if he ever does you any wrong , I shall kill him . "
29527	29536	29537	29537	she	725	" Come away , Jim ; come away , "
29591	29658	29586	29586	her	725	" You are foolish , Jim , utterly foolish ; a bad - tempered boy , that is all . How can you say such horrible things ? You do n't know what you are talking about . You are simply jealous and unkind . Ah ! I wish you would fall in love . Love makes people good , and what you said was wicked . "
29659	29664	29665	29665	he	664	" I am sixteen , "
29668	29730	29586	29586	her	725	" and I know what I am about . Mother is no help to you . She does n't understand how to look after you . I wish now that I was not going to Australia at all . I have a great mind to chuck the whole thing up . I would , if my articles had n't been signed . "
29731	29806	29861	29861	she	728	" Oh , do n't be so serious , Jim . You are like one of the heroes of those silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in . I am not going to quarrel with you . I have seen him , and oh ! to see him is perfect happiness . We wo n't quarrel . I know you would never harm any one I love , would you ? "
29807	29819	29861	29861	she	728	" Not as long as you love him , I suppose , "
29825	29833	29834	29834	she	728	" I shall love him for ever ! "
29837	29841	29861	29861	she	728	" And he ? "
29842	29848	29861	29861	she	728	" For ever , too ! "
29849	29854	29861	29861	she	728	" He had better . "
30220	30230	30231	30231	he	183	" Mother , I have something to ask you , "
30247	30267	30242	30242	She	2139	" Tell me the truth . I have a right to know . Were you married to my father ? "
30359	30362	30363	30363	she	2139	" No , "
30374	30382	30384	30385	the lad	405	" My father was a scoundrel then ! "
30396	30449	30391	30391	She	2139	" I knew he was not free . We loved each other very much . If he had lived , he would have made provision for us . Do n't speak against him , my son . He was your father , and a gentleman . Indeed , he was highly connected . "
30457	30465	30466	30466	he	405	" I do n't care for myself , "
30469	30505	30466	30466	he	405	" but do n't let Sibyl .... It is a gentleman , is n't it , who is in love with her , or says he is ? Highly connected , too , I suppose . "
30531	30537	30538	30538	she	747	" Sibyl has a mother , "
30541	30546	30538	30538	she	747	" I had none . "
30565	30580	30581	30581	he	405	" I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father , "
30584	30650	30581	30581	he	405	" but I could not help it . I must go now . Good - bye . Do n't forget that you will have only one child now to look after , and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister , I will find out who he is , track him down , and kill him like a dog . I swear it . "
30860	30871	30873	30874	Lord Henry	112	" I suppose you have heard the news , Basil ? "
30897	30902	30904	30905	the artist	365	" No , Harry , "
30917	30962	30904	30905	the artist	365	" What is it ? Nothing about politics , I hope ! They do n't interest me . There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons worth painting , though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing . "
30963	30972	30974	30975	Lord Henry	112	" Dorian Gray is engaged to be married , "
30989	30996	30997	30997	he	113	" Dorian engaged to be married ! "
31000	31003	30997	30997	he	113	" Impossible ! "
31004	31010	30904	30905	the artist	365	" It is perfectly true . "
31011	31015	30997	30997	he	113	" To whom ? "
31016	31024	30904	30905	the artist	365	" To some little actress or other . "
31025	31038	30997	30997	he	113	" I ca n't believe it . Dorian is far too sensible . "
31039	31058	30904	30905	the artist	365	" Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then , my dear Basil . "
31059	31075	30997	30997	he	113	" Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then , Harry . "
31076	31081	31083	31084	Lord Henry	112	" Except in America , "
31087	31143	31083	31084	Lord Henry	112	" But I did n't say he was married . I said he was engaged to be married . There is a great difference . I have a distinct remembrance of being married , but I have no recollection at all of being engaged . I am inclined to think that I never was engaged . "
31144	31171	30997	30997	he	113	" But think of Dorian 's birth , and position , and wealth . It would be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him . "
31172	31215	31083	31084	Lord Henry	112	" If you want to make him marry this girl , tell him that , Basil . He is sure to do it , then . Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing , it is always from the noblest motives . "
31216	31249	30997	30997	he	113	" I hope the girl is good , Harry . I do n't want to see Dorian tied to some vile creature , who might degrade his nature and ruin his intellect . "
31250	31263	31265	31266	Lord Henry	112	" Oh , she is better than good - she is beautiful , "
31278	31341	30997	30997	he	113	" Dorian says she is beautiful , and he is not often wrong about things of that kind . Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of other people . It has had that excellent effect , amongst others . We are to see her to - night , if that boy does n't forget his appointment . "
31342	31347	30997	30997	he	113	" Are you serious ? "
31348	31375	30997	30997	he	113	" Quite serious , Basil . I should be miserable if I thought I should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment . "
31376	31386	31388	31389	the painter	366	" But do you approve of it , Harry ? "
31402	31418	31399	31399	his	366	" You ca n't approve of it , possibly . It is some silly infatuation . "
31419	31678	30997	30997	he	113	" I never approve , or disapprove , of anything now . It is an absurd attitude to take towards life . We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices . I never take any notice of what common people say , and I never interfere with what charming people do . If a personality fascinates me , whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me . Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet , and proposes to marry her . Why not ? If he wedded Messalina , he would be none the less interesting . You know I am not a champion of marriage . The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish . And unselfish people are colourless . They lack individuality . Still , there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex . They retain their egotism , and add to it many other egos . They are forced to have more than one life . They become more highly organized , and to be highly organized is , I should fancy , the object of man 's existence . Besides , every experience is of value , and whatever one may say against marriage , it is certainly an experience . I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife , passionately adore her for six months , and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else . He would be a wonderful study . "
31679	31725	31399	31399	his	366	" You do n't mean a single word of all that , Harry ; you know you do n't . If Dorian Gray 's life were spoiled , no one would be sorrier than yourself . You are much better than you pretend to be . "
31730	31915	31726	31727	Lord Henry	112	" The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves . The basis of optimism is sheer terror . We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us . We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account , and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets . I mean everything that I have said . I have the greatest contempt for optimism . As for a spoiled life , no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested . If you want to mar a nature , you have merely to reform it . As for marriage , of course that would be silly , but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women . I will certainly encourage them . They have the charm of being fashionable . But here is Dorian himself . He will tell you more than I can . "
31916	31931	31933	31934	the lad	405	" My dear Harry , my dear Basil , you must both congratulate me ! "
31959	32000	32001	32001	He	405	" I have never been so happy . Of course , it is sudden - all really delightful things are . And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life . "
32014	32026	32028	32028	Hallward	113	" I hope you will always be very happy , Dorian , "
32030	32053	32028	32028	Hallward	113	" but I do n't quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement . You let Harry know . "
32054	32067	32070	32071	Lord Henry	112	" And I do n't forgive you for being late for dinner , "
32087	32118	32070	32071	Lord Henry	112	" Come , let us sit down and try what the new _ chef _ here is like , and then you will tell us how it all came about . "
32119	32128	32130	32130	Dorian	115	" There is really not much to tell , "
32142	32618	32130	32130	Dorian	115	" What happened was simply this . After I left you yesterday evening , Harry , I dressed , had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to , and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre . Sibyl was playing Rosalind . Of course , the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd . But Sibyl ! You should have seen her ! When she came on in her boy 's clothes , she was perfectly wonderful . She wore a moss - coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves , slim , brown , cross - gartered hose , a dainty little green cap with a hawk 's feather caught in a jewel , and a hooded cloak lined with dull red . She had never seemed to me more exquisite . She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio , Basil . Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose . As for her acting - well , you shall see her to - night . She is simply a born artist . I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled . I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century . I was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen . After the performance was over , I went behind and spoke to her . As we were sitting together , suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there before . My lips moved towards hers . We kissed each other . I ca n't describe to you what I felt at that moment . It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose - coloured joy . She trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus . Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands . I feel that I should not tell you all this , but I ca n't help it . Of course , our engagement is a dead secret . She has not even told her own mother . I do n't know what my guardians will say . Lord Radley is sure to be furious . I do n't care . I shall be of age in less than a year , and then I can do what I like . I have been right , Basil , have n't I , to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare 's plays ? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear . I have had the arms of Rosalind around me , and kissed Juliet on the mouth . "
32619	32630	32632	32632	Hallward	113	" Yes , Dorian , I suppose you were right , "
32635	32644	32646	32647	Lord Henry	112	" Have you seen her to - day ? "
32655	32675	32652	32652	his	115	" I left her in the forest of Arden ; I shall find her in an orchard in Verona . "
32686	32715	32679	32679	his	112	" At what particular point did you mention the word marriage , Dorian ? And what did she say in answer ? Perhaps you forgot all about it . "
32716	32776	32817	32817	Hallward	113	" My dear Harry , I did not treat it as a business transaction , and I did not make any formal proposal . I told her that I loved her , and she said she was not worthy to be my wife . Not worthy ! Why , the whole world is nothing to me compared with her . "
32777	32783	32785	32786	Lord Henry	112	" Women are wonderfully practical , "
32788	32816	32785	32786	Lord Henry	112	" much more practical than we are . In situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage , and they always remind us . "
32825	32860	32819	32819	his	113	" Do n't , Harry . You have annoyed Dorian . He is not like other men . He would never bring misery upon any one . His nature is too fine for that . "
32868	32876	32877	32877	he	112	" Dorian is never annoyed with me , "
32880	32953	32877	32877	he	112	" I asked the question for the best reason possible , for the only reason , indeed , that excuses one for asking any question - simple curiosity . I have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us , and not we who propose to the women . Except , of course , in middle - class life . But then the middle classes are not modern . "
32963	33156	32960	32960	his	115	" You are quite incorrigible , Harry ; but I do n't mind . It is impossible to be angry with you . When you see Sibyl Vane , you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a beast , a beast without a heart . I can not understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves . I love Sibyl Vane . I want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine . What is marriage ? An irrevocable vow . You mock at it for that . Ah ! do n't mock . It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take . Her trust makes me faithful , her belief makes me good . When I am with her , I regret all that you have taught me . I become different from what you have known me to be . I am changed , and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane 's hand makes me forget you and all your wrong , fascinating , poisonous , delightful theories . "
33157	33163	33165	33166	Lord Henry	112	" And those are ... ? "
33174	33201	33307	33307	his	115	" Oh , your theories about life , your theories about love , your theories about pleasure . All your theories , in fact , Harry . "
33202	33214	33215	33215	he	112	" Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about , "
33223	33280	33218	33218	his	112	" But I am afraid I can not claim my theory as my own . It belongs to Nature , not to me . Pleasure is Nature 's test , her sign of approval . When we are happy , we are always good , but when we are good , we are not always happy . "
33281	33292	33294	33295	Basil Hallward	113	" Ah ! but what do you mean by good ? "
33297	33300	33302	33302	Dorian	115	" Yes , "
33332	33342	33312	33313	Lord Henry	112	" what do you mean by good , Harry ? "
33343	33357	33358	33358	he	112	" To be good is to be in harmony with one 's self , "
33377	33483	33358	33358	he	112	" Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others . One 's own life - that is the important thing . As for the lives of one 's neighbours , if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan , one can flaunt one 's moral views about them , but they are not one 's concern . Besides , individualism has really the higher aim . Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one 's age . I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality . "
33484	33509	33511	33512	the painter	366	" But , surely , if one lives merely for one 's self , Harry , one pays a terrible price for doing so ? "
33514	33559	33358	33358	he	112	" Yes , we are overcharged for everything nowadays . I should fancy that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self - denial . Beautiful sins , like beautiful things , are the privilege of the rich . "
33560	33571	33358	33358	he	112	" One has to pay in other ways but money . "
33572	33580	33358	33358	he	112	" What sort of ways , Basil ? "
33581	33603	33358	33358	he	112	" Oh ! I should fancy in remorse , in suffering , in ... well , in the consciousness of degradation . "
33610	33683	33607	33607	his	112	" My dear fellow , medieval art is charming , but medieval emotions are out of date . One can use them in fiction , of course . But then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact . Believe me , no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure , and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is . "
33684	33691	33693	33694	Dorian Gray	115	" I know what pleasure is , "
33696	33704	33693	33694	Dorian Gray	115	" It is to adore some one . "
33705	33714	33715	33715	he	115	" That is certainly better than being adored , "
33723	33755	33715	33715	he	115	" Being adored is a nuisance . Women treat us just as humanity treats its gods . They worship us , and are always bothering us to do something for them . "
33756	33773	33775	33776	the lad	405	" I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to us , "
33779	33796	33775	33776	the lad	405	" They create love in our natures . They have a right to demand it back . "
33797	33805	33807	33807	Hallward	113	" That is quite true , Dorian , "
33809	33816	33818	33819	Lord Henry	112	" Nothing is ever quite true , "
33821	33825	33827	33827	Dorian	115	" This is , "
33829	33848	33827	33827	Dorian	115	" You must admit , Harry , that women give to men the very gold of their lives . "
33849	33852	33853	33853	he	115	" Possibly , "
33856	33901	33853	33853	he	115	" but they invariably want it back in such very small change . That is the worry . Women , as some witty Frenchman once put it , inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out . "
33902	33920	33827	33827	Dorian	115	" Harry , you are dreadful ! I do n't know why I like you so much . "
33921	33930	33931	33931	he	115	" You will always like me , Dorian , "
33934	34044	33931	33931	he	115	" Will you have some coffee , you fellows ? Waiter , bring coffee , and _ fine - champagne _ , and some cigarettes . No , do n't mind the cigarettes - I have some . Basil , I ca n't allow you to smoke cigars . You must have a cigarette . A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure . It is exquisite , and it leaves one unsatisfied . What more can one want ? Yes , Dorian , you will always be fond of me . I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit . "
34045	34053	34055	34056	the lad	405	" What nonsense you talk , Harry ! "
34077	34113	34055	34056	the lad	405	" Let us go down to the theatre . When Sibyl comes on the stage you will have a new ideal of life . She will represent something to you that you have never known . "
34114	34120	34122	34123	Lord Henry	112	" I have known everything , "
34133	34224	34122	34123	Lord Henry	112	" but I am always ready for a new emotion . I am afraid , however , that , for me at any rate , there is no such thing . Still , your wonderful girl may thrill me . I love acting . It is so much more real than life . Let us go . Dorian , you will come with me . I am so sorry , Basil , but there is only room for two in the brougham . You must follow us in a hansom . "
34623	34634	34636	34637	Lord Henry	112	" What a place to find one 's divinity in ! "
34639	34642	34644	34645	Dorian Gray	115	" Yes ! "
34647	34744	34644	34645	Dorian Gray	115	" It was here I found her , and she is divine beyond all living things . When she acts , you will forget everything . These common rough people , with their coarse faces and brutal gestures , become quite different when she is on the stage . They sit silently and watch her . They weep and laugh as she wills them to do . She makes them as responsive as a violin . She spiritualizes them , and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one 's self . "
34745	34762	34764	34765	Lord Henry	112	" The same flesh and blood as one 's self ! Oh , I hope not ! "
34781	34792	34794	34795	the painter	366	" Do n't pay any attention to him , Dorian , "
34797	34951	34794	34795	the painter	366	" I understand what you mean , and I believe in this girl . Any one you love must be marvellous , and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble . To spiritualize one 's age - that is something worth doing . If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one , if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly , if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own , she is worthy of all your adoration , worthy of the adoration of the world . This marriage is quite right . I did not think so at first , but I admit it now . The gods made Sibyl Vane for you . Without her you would have been incomplete . "
34952	34957	34959	34960	Dorian Gray	115	" Thanks , Basil , "
34966	35038	34959	34960	Dorian Gray	115	" I knew that you would understand me . Harry is so cynical , he terrifies me . But here is the orchestra . It is quite dreadful , but it only lasts for about five minutes . Then the curtain rises , and you will see the girl to whom I am going to give all my life , to whom I have given everything that is good in me . "
35180	35185	35175	35175	his	112	" Charming ! charming ! "
35648	35652	35677	35677	she	166	" It lightens . "
35811	35819	35820	35820	he	112	" She is quite beautiful , Dorian , "
35823	35834	35820	35820	he	112	" but she ca n't act . Let us go . "
35835	35845	35847	35848	the lad	405	" I am going to see the play through , "
35856	35878	35847	35848	the lad	405	" I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening , Harry . I apologize to you both . "
35879	35892	35894	35894	Hallward	113	" My dear Dorian , I should think Miss Vane was ill , "
35896	35904	35894	35894	Hallward	113	" We will come some other night . "
35905	35912	35913	35913	he	113	" I wish she were ill , "
35916	35952	35913	35913	he	113	" But she seems to me to be simply callous and cold . She has entirely altered . Last night she was a great artist . This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress . "
35953	35976	35847	35848	the lad	405	" Do n't talk like that about any one you love , Dorian . Love is a more wonderful thing than art . "
35977	35986	35988	35989	Lord Henry	112	" They are both simply forms of imitation , "
35991	36160	35988	35989	Lord Henry	112	" But do let us go . Dorian , you must not stay here any longer . It is not good for one 's morals to see bad acting . Besides , I do n't suppose you will want your wife to act , so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll ? She is very lovely , and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting , she will be a delightful experience . There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating - people who know absolutely everything , and people who know absolutely nothing . Good heavens , my dear boy , do n't look so tragic ! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming . Come to the club with Basil and myself . We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane . She is beautiful . What more can you want ? "
36161	36167	36169	36170	the lad	405	" Go away , Harry , "
36172	36197	36169	36170	the lad	405	" I want to be alone . Basil , you must go . Ah ! ca n't you see that my heart is breaking ? "
36233	36240	36242	36243	Lord Henry	112	" Let us go , Basil , "
36429	36440	36441	36441	she	2162	" How badly I acted to - night , Dorian ! "
36444	36447	36448	36448	he	115	" Horribly ! "
36457	36484	36448	36448	he	115	" Horribly ! It was dreadful . Are you ill ? You have no idea what it was . You have no idea what I suffered . "
36489	36492	36493	36493	she	2162	" Dorian , "
36524	36541	36493	36493	she	2162	" Dorian , you should have understood . But you understand now , do n't you ? "
36542	36546	36547	36547	he	115	" Understand what ? "
36552	36577	36506	36506	her	2162	" Why I was so bad to - night . Why I shall always be bad . Why I shall never act well again . "
36583	36614	36578	36578	He	115	" You are ill , I suppose . When you are ill you should n't act . You make yourself ridiculous . My friends were bored . I was bored . "
36636	36641	36642	36642	she	2162	" Dorian , Dorian , "
36645	37098	36642	36642	she	2162	" before I knew you , acting was the one reality of my life . It was only in the theatre that I lived . I thought that it was all true . I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other . The joy of Beatrice was my joy , and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also . I believed in everything . The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike . The painted scenes were my world . I knew nothing but shadows , and I thought them real . You came - oh , my beautiful love!-and you freed my soul from prison . You taught me what reality really is . To - night , for the first time in my life , I saw through the hollowness , the sham , the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had always played . To - night , for the first time , I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous , and old , and painted , that the moonlight in the orchard was false , that the scenery was vulgar , and that the words I had to speak were unreal , were not my words , were not what I wanted to say . You had brought me something higher , something of which all art is but a reflection . You had made me understand what love really is . My love ! My love ! Prince Charming ! Prince of life ! I have grown sick of shadows . You are more to me than all art can ever be . What have I to do with the puppets of a play ? When I came on to - night , I could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me . I thought that I was going to be wonderful . I found that I could do nothing . Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant . The knowledge was exquisite to me . I heard them hissing , and I smiled . What could they know of love such as ours ? Take me away , Dorian - take me away with you , where we can be quite alone . I hate the stage . I might mimic a passion that I do not feel , but I can not mimic one that burns me like fire . Oh , Dorian , Dorian , you understand now what it signifies ? Even if I could do it , it would be profanation for me to play at being in love . You have made me see that . "
37112	37119	37120	37120	he	821	" You have killed my love , "
37185	37188	37189	37189	he	821	" Yes , "
37192	37425	37189	37189	he	821	" you have killed my love . You used to stir my imagination . Now you do n't even stir my curiosity . You simply produce no effect . I loved you because you were marvellous , because you had genius and intellect , because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art . You have thrown it all away . You are shallow and stupid . My God ! how mad I was to love you ! What a fool I have been ! You are nothing to me now . I will never see you again . I will never think of you . I will never mention your name . You do n't know what you were to me , once . Why , once ... Oh , I ca n't bear to think of it ! I wish I had never laid eyes upon you ! You have spoiled the romance of my life . How little you can know of love , if you say it mars your art ! Without your art , you are nothing . I would have made you famous , splendid , magnificent . The world would have worshipped you , and you would have borne my name . What are you now ? A third - rate actress with a pretty face . "
37450	37458	37459	37459	she	2162	" You are not serious , Dorian ? "
37462	37467	37459	37459	she	2162	" You are acting . "
37468	37483	37484	37484	he	824	" Acting ! I leave that to you . You do it so well , "
37530	37536	37537	37537	he	824	" Do n't touch me ! "
37562	37572	37573	37573	she	2162	" Dorian , Dorian , do n't leave me ! "
37576	37791	37573	37573	she	2162	" I am so sorry I did n't act well . I was thinking of you all the time . But I will try - indeed , I will try . It came so suddenly across me , my love for you . I think I should never have known it if you had not kissed me - if we had not kissed each other . Kiss me again , my love . Do n't go away from me . I could n't bear it . Oh ! do n't go away from me . My brother ... No ; never mind . He did n't mean it . He was in jest .... But you , oh ! ca n't you forgive me for to - night ? I will work so hard and try to improve . Do n't be cruel to me , because I love you better than anything in the world . After all , it is only once that I have not pleased you . But you are quite right , Dorian . I should have shown myself more of an artist . It was foolish of me , and yet I could n't help it . Oh , do n't leave me , do n't leave me . "
37867	37872	37873	37873	he	115	" I am going , "
37883	37905	37873	37873	he	115	" I do n't wish to be unkind , but I ca n't see you again . You have disappointed me . "
39609	39613	39614	39614	he	115	" How horrible ! "
39799	39807	39808	39808	he	197	" Monsieur has well slept this morning , "
39813	39821	39823	39824	Dorian Gray	115	" What o'clock is it , Victor ? "
39827	39836	39823	39824	Dorian Gray	115	" One hour and a quarter , Monsieur . "
40206	40212	40214	40215	his valet	484	" Too cold for Monsieur ? "
40224	40230	40214	40215	his valet	484	" I shut the window ? "
40236	40242	40243	40243	he	115	" I am not cold , "
40438	40450	40451	40451	he	115	" I am not at home to any one , Victor , "
41176	41203	41170	41171	Lord Henry	112	" My dear boy , I must see you . Let me in at once . I ca n't bear your shutting yourself up like this . "
41284	41295	41300	41300	he	112	" I am so sorry for it all , Dorian , "
41303	41314	41300	41300	he	112	" But you must not think too much about it . "
41315	41323	41325	41326	the lad	405	" Do you mean about Sibyl Vane ? "
41328	41334	41336	41337	Lord Henry	112	" Yes , of course , "
41351	41386	41336	41337	Lord Henry	112	" It is dreadful , from one point of view , but it was not your fault . Tell me , did you go behind and see her , after the play was over ? "
41387	41390	41300	41300	he	112	" Yes . "
41391	41406	41336	41337	Lord Henry	112	" I felt sure you had . Did you make a scene with her ? "
41407	41443	41300	41300	he	112	" I was brutal , Harry - perfectly brutal . But it is all right now . I am not sorry for anything that has happened . It has taught me to know myself better . "
41444	41479	41336	41337	Lord Henry	112	" Ah , Dorian , I am so glad you take it in that way ! I was afraid I would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours . "
41480	41488	41490	41490	Dorian	115	" I have got through all that , "
41498	41568	41490	41490	Dorian	115	" I am perfectly happy now . I know what conscience is , to begin with . It is not what you told me it was . It is the divinest thing in us . Do n't sneer at it , Harry , any more - at least not before me . I want to be good . I ca n't bear the idea of my soul being hideous . "
41569	41594	41336	41337	Lord Henry	112	" A very charming artistic basis for ethics , Dorian ! I congratulate you on it . But how are you going to begin ? "
41595	41601	41490	41490	Dorian	115	" By marrying Sibyl Vane . "
41602	41607	41609	41610	Lord Henry	112	" Marrying Sibyl Vane ! "
41622	41628	41609	41610	Lord Henry	112	" But , my dear Dorian- "
41629	41693	41490	41490	Dorian	115	" Yes , Harry , I know what you are going to say . Something dreadful about marriage . Do n't say it . Do n't ever say things of that kind to me again . Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me . I am not going to break my word to her . She is to be my wife . "
41694	41725	41609	41610	Lord Henry	112	" Your wife ! Dorian ! ... Did n't you get my letter ? I wrote to you this morning , and sent the note down by my own man . "
41726	41770	41490	41490	Dorian	115	" Your letter ? Oh , yes , I remember . I have not read it yet , Harry . I was afraid there might be something in it that I would n't like . You cut life to pieces with your epigrams . "
41771	41777	41609	41610	Lord Henry	112	" You know nothing then ? "
41778	41784	41490	41490	Dorian	115	" What do you mean ? "
41811	41814	41815	41815	he	112	" Dorian , "
41818	41836	41815	41815	he	112	" my letter - don't be frightened - was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead . "
41865	41888	41849	41849	he	405	" Dead ! Sibyl dead ! It is not true ! It is a horrible lie ! How dare you say it ? "
41889	41897	41899	41900	Lord Henry	112	" It is quite true , Dorian , "
41904	42037	41899	41900	Lord Henry	112	" It is in all the morning papers . I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till I came . There will have to be an inquest , of course , and you must not be mixed up in it . Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris . But in London people are so prejudiced . Here , one should never make one 's _ debut _ with a scandal . One should reserve that to give an interest to one 's old age . I suppose they do n't know your name at the theatre ? If they do n't , it is all right . Did any one see you going round to her room ? That is an important point . "
42062	42101	42054	42054	he	115	" Harry , did you say an inquest ? What did you mean by that ? Did Sibyl- ? Oh , Harry , I ca n't bear it ! But be quick . Tell me everything at once . "
42102	42237	41899	41900	Lord Henry	112	" I have no doubt it was not an accident , Dorian , though it must be put in that way to the public . It seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her mother , about half - past twelve or so , she said she had forgotten something upstairs . They waited some time for her , but she did not come down again . They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing - room . She had swallowed something by mistake , some dreadful thing they use at theatres . I do n't know what it was , but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it . I should fancy it was prussic acid , as she seems to have died instantaneously . "
42238	42247	42249	42250	the lad	405	" Harry , Harry , it is terrible ! "
42252	42373	41899	41900	Lord Henry	112	" Yes ; it is very tragic , of course , but you must not get yourself mixed up in it . I see by _ The Standard _ that she was seventeen . I should have thought she was almost younger than that . She looked such a child , and seemed to know so little about acting . Dorian , you must n't let this thing get on your nerves . You must come and dine with me , and afterwards we will look in at the opera . It is a Patti night , and everybody will be there . You can come to my sister 's box . She has got some smart women with her . "
42374	42382	42384	42385	Dorian Gray	115	" So I have murdered Sibyl Vane , "
42391	42737	42384	42385	Dorian Gray	115	" murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife . Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that . The birds sing just as happily in my garden . And to - night I am to dine with you , and then go on to the opera , and sup somewhere , I suppose , afterwards . How extraordinarily dramatic life is ! If I had read all this in a book , Harry , I think I would have wept over it . Somehow , now that it has happened actually , and to me , it seems far too wonderful for tears . Here is the first passionate love - letter I have ever written in my life . Strange , that my first passionate love - letter should have been addressed to a dead girl . Can they feel , I wonder , those white silent people we call the dead ? Sibyl ! Can she feel , or know , or listen ? Oh , Harry , how I loved her once ! It seems years ago to me now . She was everything to me . Then came that dreadful night - was it really only last night?-when she played so badly , and my heart almost broke . She explained it all to me . It was terribly pathetic . But I was not moved a bit . I thought her shallow . Suddenly something happened that made me afraid . I ca n't tell you what it was , but it was terrible . I said I would go back to her . I felt I had done wrong . And now she is dead . My God ! My God ! Harry , what shall I do ? You do n't know the danger I am in , and there is nothing to keep me straight . She would have done that for me . She had no right to kill herself . It was selfish of her . "
42738	42743	42745	42746	Lord Henry	112	" My dear Dorian , "
42762	42915	42745	42746	Lord Henry	112	" the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life . If you had married this girl , you would have been wretched . Of course , you would have treated her kindly . One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing . But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her . And when a woman finds that out about her husband , she either becomes dreadfully dowdy , or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman 's husband has to pay for . I say nothing about the social mistake , which would have been abject - which , of course , I would not have allowed - but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure . "
42916	42922	42924	42925	the lad	405	" I suppose it would , "
42938	42990	42924	42925	the lad	405	" But I thought it was my duty . It is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right . I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutions - that they are always made too late . Mine certainly were . "
42991	43066	42745	42746	Lord Henry	112	" Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws . Their origin is pure vanity . Their result is absolutely _ nil _ . They give us , now and then , some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak . That is all that can be said for them . They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account . "
43067	43070	43072	43073	Dorian Gray	115	" Harry , "
43083	43112	43072	43073	Dorian Gray	115	" why is it that I can not feel this tragedy as much as I want to ? I do n't think I am heartless . Do you ? "
43113	43136	43138	43139	Lord Henry	112	" You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be entitled to give yourself that name , Dorian , "
43150	43160	43161	43161	he	112	" I do n't like that explanation , Harry , "
43164	43255	43161	43161	he	112	" but I am glad you do n't think I am heartless . I am nothing of the kind . I know I am not . And yet I must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should . It seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play . It has all the terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy , a tragedy in which I took a great part , but by which I have not been wounded . "
43256	43263	43265	43266	Lord Henry	112	" It is an interesting question , "
43282	43594	43265	43266	Lord Henry	112	" an extremely interesting question . I fancy that the true explanation is this : It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence , their absolute incoherence , their absurd want of meaning , their entire lack of style . They affect us just as vulgarity affects us . They give us an impression of sheer brute force , and we revolt against that . Sometimes , however , a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives . If these elements of beauty are real , the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect . Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors , but the spectators of the play . Or rather we are both . We watch ourselves , and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us . In the present case , what is it that has really happened ? Some one has killed herself for love of you . I wish that I had ever had such an experience . It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life . The people who have adored me - there have not been very many , but there have been some - have always insisted on living on , long after I had ceased to care for them , or they to care for me . They have become stout and tedious , and when I meet them , they go in at once for reminiscences . That awful memory of woman ! What a fearful thing it is ! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals ! One should absorb the colour of life , but one should never remember its details . Details are always vulgar . "
43595	43604	43606	43606	Dorian	115	" I must sow poppies in my garden , "
43608	43614	43616	43617	his companion	374	" There is no necessity , "
43619	44100	43616	43617	his companion	374	" Life has always poppies in her hands . Of course , now and then things linger . I once wore nothing but violets all through one season , as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die . Ultimately , however , it did die . I forget what killed it . I think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me . That is always a dreadful moment . It fills one with the terror of eternity . Well - would you believe it?-a week ago , at Lady Hampshire 's , I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question , and she insisted on going over the whole thing again , and digging up the past , and raking up the future . I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel . She dragged it out again and assured me that I had spoiled her life . I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner , so I did not feel any anxiety . But what a lack of taste she showed ! The one charm of the past is that it is the past . But women never know when the curtain has fallen . They always want a sixth act , and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over , they propose to continue it . If they were allowed their own way , every comedy would have a tragic ending , and every tragedy would culminate in a farce . They are charmingly artificial , but they have no sense of art . You are more fortunate than I am . I assure you , Dorian , that not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you . Ordinary women always console themselves . Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours . Never trust a woman who wears mauve , whatever her age may be , or a woman over thirty - five who is fond of pink ribbons . It always means that they have a history . Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands . They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one 's face , as if it were the most fascinating of sins . Religion consoles some . Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation , a woman once told me , and I can quite understand it . Besides , nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner . Conscience makes egotists of us all . Yes ; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life . Indeed , I have not mentioned the most important one . "
44101	44108	44110	44111	the lad	405	" What is that , Harry ? "
44114	44211	43616	43617	his companion	374	" Oh , the obvious consolation . Taking some one else 's admirer when one loses one 's own . In good society that always whitewashes a woman . But really , Dorian , how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the women one meets ! There is something to me quite beautiful about her death . I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen . They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with , such as romance , passion , and love . "
44212	44224	43616	43617	his companion	374	" I was terribly cruel to her . You forget that . "
44225	44340	43616	43617	his companion	374	" I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty , downright cruelty , more than anything else . They have wonderfully primitive instincts . We have emancipated them , but they remain slaves looking for their masters , all the same . They love being dominated . I am sure you were splendid . I have never seen you really and absolutely angry , but I can fancy how delightful you looked . And , after all , you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful , but that I see now was absolutely true , and it holds the key to everything . "
44341	44348	43616	43617	his companion	374	" What was that , Harry ? "
44349	44392	43616	43617	his companion	374	" You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of romance - that she was Desdemona one night , and Ophelia the other ; that if she died as Juliet , she came to life as Imogen . "
44393	44403	44405	44406	the lad	405	" She will never come to life again now , "
44415	44595	43616	43617	his companion	374	" No , she will never come to life . She has played her last part . But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing - room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy , as a wonderful scene from Webster , or Ford , or Cyril Tourneur . The girl never really lived , and so she has never really died . To you at least she was always a dream , a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare 's plays and left them lovelier for its presence , a reed through which Shakespeare 's music sounded richer and more full of joy . The moment she touched actual life , she marred it , and it marred her , and so she passed away . Mourn for Ophelia , if you like . Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled . Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died . But do n't waste your tears over Sibyl Vane . She was less real than they are . "
44639	44649	44650	44650	he	115	" You have explained me to myself , Harry , "
44660	44728	44650	44650	he	115	" I felt all that you have said , but somehow I was afraid of it , and I could not express it to myself . How well you know me ! But we will not talk again of what has happened . It has been a marvellous experience . That is all . I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous . "
44729	44759	45046	45046	he	112	" Life has everything in store for you , Dorian . There is nothing that you , with your extraordinary good looks , will not be able to do . "
44760	44779	44650	44650	he	115	" But suppose , Harry , I became haggard , and old , and wrinkled ? What then ? "
44780	44785	44787	44788	Lord Henry	112	" Ah , then , "
44794	44879	44787	44788	Lord Henry	112	" then , my dear Dorian , you would have to fight for your victories . As it is , they are brought to you . No , you must keep your good looks . We live in an age that reads too much to be wise , and that thinks too much to be beautiful . We can not spare you . And now you had better dress and drive down to the club . We are rather late , as it is . "
44880	44911	44650	44650	he	115	" I think I shall join you at the opera , Harry . I feel too tired to eat anything . What is the number of your sister 's box ? "
44912	44947	44787	44788	Lord Henry	112	" Twenty - seven , I believe . It is on the grand tier . You will see her name on the door . But I am sorry you wo n't come and dine . "
44948	44957	44959	44959	Dorian	115	" I do n't feel up to it , "
44962	44996	44959	44959	Dorian	115	" But I am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me . You are certainly my best friend . No one has ever understood me as you have . "
44997	45010	45012	45013	Lord Henry	112	" We are only at the beginning of our friendship , Dorian , "
45021	45044	45012	45013	Lord Henry	112	" Good - bye . I shall see you before nine - thirty , I hope . Remember , Patti is singing . "
46079	46091	46092	46092	he	113	" I am so glad I have found you , Dorian , "
46096	46312	46092	46092	he	113	" I called last night , and they told me you were at the opera . Of course , I knew that was impossible . But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to . I passed a dreadful evening , half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another . I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first . I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of _ The Globe _ that I picked up at the club . I came here at once and was miserable at not finding you . I ca n't tell you how heart - broken I am about the whole thing . I know what you must suffer . But where were you ? Did you go down and see the girl 's mother ? For a moment I thought of following you there . They gave the address in the paper . Somewhere in the Euston Road , is n't it ? But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten . Poor woman ! What a state she must be in ! And her only child , too ! What did she say about it all ? "
46313	46323	46325	46326	Dorian Gray	115	" My dear Basil , how do I know ? "
46350	46484	46092	46092	he	113	" I was at the opera . You should have come on there . I met Lady Gwendolen , Harry 's sister , for the first time . We were in her box . She is perfectly charming ; and Patti sang divinely . Do n't talk about horrid subjects . If one does n't talk about a thing , it has never happened . It is simply expression , as Harry says , that gives reality to things . I may mention that she was not the woman 's only child . There is a son , a charming fellow , I believe . But he is not on the stage . He is a sailor , or something . And now , tell me about yourself and what you are painting . "
46485	46492	46494	46494	Hallward	113	" You went to the opera ? "
46510	46577	46507	46507	his	113	" You went to the opera while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging ? You can talk to me of other women being charming , and of Patti singing divinely , before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in ? Why , man , there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers ! "
46578	46589	46591	46591	Dorian	115	" Stop , Basil ! I wo n't hear it ! "
46598	46619	46591	46591	Dorian	115	" You must not tell me about things . What is done is done . What is past is past . "
46620	46627	46507	46507	his	113	" You call yesterday the past ? "
46628	46705	46591	46591	Dorian	115	" What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it ? It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion . A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure . I do n't want to be at the mercy of my emotions . I want to use them , to enjoy them , and to dominate them . "
46706	46804	46507	46507	his	113	" Dorian , this is horrible ! Something has changed you completely . You look exactly the same wonderful boy who , day after day , used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture . But you were simple , natural , and affectionate then . You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world . Now , I do n't know what has come over you . You talk as if you had no heart , no pity in you . It is all Harry 's influence . I see that . "
46833	46844	46845	46845	he	405	" I owe a great deal to Harry , Basil , "
46850	46866	46845	46845	he	405	" more than I owe to you . You only taught me to be vain . "
46867	46884	46507	46507	his	113	" Well , I am punished for that , Dorian - or shall be some day . "
46885	46896	46897	46897	he	405	" I do n't know what you mean , Basil , "
46903	46917	46897	46897	he	405	" I do n't know what you want . What do you want ? "
46918	46929	46931	46932	the artist	365	" I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint , "
46935	46938	46940	46941	the lad	405	" Basil , "
46955	46973	46940	46941	the lad	405	" you have come too late . Yesterday , when I heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself- "
46974	46988	46990	46990	Hallward	113	" Killed herself ! Good heavens ! is there no doubt about that ? "
47002	47024	46940	46941	the lad	405	" My dear Basil ! Surely you do n't think it was a vulgar accident ? Of course she killed herself . "
47035	47039	47040	47040	he	939	" How fearful , "
47050	47053	47055	47056	Dorian Gray	115	" No , "
47058	47764	47055	47056	Dorian Gray	115	" there is nothing fearful about it . It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age . As a rule , people who act lead the most commonplace lives . They are good husbands , or faithful wives , or something tedious . You know what I mean - middle - class virtue and all that kind of thing . How different Sibyl was ! She lived her finest tragedy . She was always a heroine . The last night she played - the night you saw her - she acted badly because she had known the reality of love . When she knew its unreality , she died , as Juliet might have died . She passed again into the sphere of art . There is something of the martyr about her . Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom , all its wasted beauty . But , as I was saying , you must not think I have not suffered . If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment - about half - past five , perhaps , or a quarter to six - you would have found me in tears . Even Harry , who was here , who brought me the news , in fact , had no idea what I was going through . I suffered immensely . Then it passed away . I can not repeat an emotion . No one can , except sentimentalists . And you are awfully unjust , Basil . You come down here to console me . That is charming of you . You find me consoled , and you are furious . How like a sympathetic person ! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed , or some unjust law altered - I forget exactly what it was . Finally he succeeded , and nothing could exceed his disappointment . He had absolutely nothing to do , almost died of _ ennui _ , and became a confirmed misanthrope . And besides , my dear old Basil , if you really want to console me , teach me rather to forget what has happened , or to see it from a proper artistic point of view . Was it not Gautier who used to write about _ la consolation des arts _ ? I remember picking up a little vellum - covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase . Well , I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together , the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life . I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle . Old brocades , green bronzes , lacquer - work , carved ivories , exquisite surroundings , luxury , pomp - there is much to be got from all these . But the artistic temperament that they create , or at any rate reveal , is still more to me . To become the spectator of one 's own life , as Harry says , is to escape the suffering of life . I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this . You have not realized how I have developed . I was a schoolboy when you knew me . I am a man now . I have new passions , new thoughts , new ideas . I am different , but you must not like me less . I am changed , but you must always be my friend . Of course , I am very fond of Harry . But I know that you are better than he is . You are not stronger - you are too much afraid of life - but you are better . And how happy we used to be together ! Do n't leave me , Basil , and do n't quarrel with me . I am what I am . There is nothing more to be said . "
47837	47842	47843	47843	he	366	" Well , Dorian , "
47853	47899	47843	47843	he	366	" I wo n't speak to you again about this horrible thing , after to - day . I only trust your name wo n't be mentioned in connection with it . The inquest is to take place this afternoon . Have they summoned you ? "
47920	47923	47902	47902	his	115	" inquest . "
47937	47945	47946	47946	he	115	" They do n't know my name , "
47949	47955	47902	47902	his	115	" But surely she did ? "
47956	48042	47902	47902	his	115	" Only my Christian name , and that I am quite sure she never mentioned to any one . She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who I was , and that she invariably told them my name was Prince Charming . It was pretty of her . You must do me a drawing of Sibyl , Basil . I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words . "
48043	48078	47902	47902	his	115	" I will try and do something , Dorian , if it would please you . But you must come and sit to me yourself again . I ca n't get on without you . "
48079	48094	48095	48095	he	942	" I can never sit to you again , Basil . It is impossible ! "
48107	48115	48116	48116	he	942	" My dear boy , what nonsense ! "
48119	48198	48116	48116	he	942	" Do you mean to say you do n't like what I did of you ? Where is it ? Why have you pulled the screen in front of it ? Let me look at it . It is the best thing I have ever done . Do take the screen away , Dorian . It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that . I felt the room looked different as I came in . "
48199	48252	48300	48300	he	115	" My servant has nothing to do with it , Basil . You do n't imagine I let him arrange my room for me ? He settles my flowers for me sometimes - that is all . No ; I did it myself . The light was too strong on the portrait . "
48253	48277	48116	48116	he	942	" Too strong ! Surely not , my dear fellow ? It is an admirable place for it . Let me see it . "
48309	48312	48313	48313	he	115	" Basil , "
48320	48335	48313	48313	he	115	" you must not look at it . I do n't wish you to . "
48336	48357	48359	48359	Hallward	113	" Not look at my own work ! You are not serious . Why should n't I look at it ? "
48363	48429	48313	48313	he	115	" If you try to look at it , Basil , on my word of honour I will never speak to you again as long as I live . I am quite serious . I do n't offer any explanation , and you are not to ask for any . But , remember , if you touch this screen , everything is over between us . "
48484	48487	48478	48478	He	405	" Dorian ! "
48488	48493	48452	48453	The lad	405	" Do n't speak ! "
48494	48517	48518	48518	he	405	" But what is the matter ? Of course I wo n't look at it if you do n't want me to , "
48535	48596	48518	48518	he	405	" But , really , it seems rather absurd that I should n't see my own work , especially as I am going to exhibit it in Paris in the autumn . I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that , so I must see it some day , and why not to - day ? "
48597	48608	48610	48611	Dorian Gray	115	" To exhibit it ! You want to exhibit it ? "
48662	48755	48756	48757	Dorian Gray	115	" Yes ; I do n't suppose you will object to that . Georges Petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de Seze , which will open the first week in October . The portrait will only be away a month . I should think you could easily spare it for that time . In fact , you are sure to be out of town . And if you keep it always behind a screen , you ca n't care much about it . "
48785	48799	48800	48800	he	115	" You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it , "
48803	48873	48800	48800	he	115	" Why have you changed your mind ? You people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have . The only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless . You ca n't have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition . You told Harry exactly the same thing . "
48906	48948	48891	48892	Lord Henry	112	" If you want to have a strange quarter of an hour , get Basil to tell you why he wo n't exhibit your picture . He told me why he would n't , and it was a revelation to me . "
48967	48970	48971	48971	he	115	" Basil , "
48986	49018	48971	48971	he	115	" we have each of us a secret . Let me know yours , and I shall tell you mine . What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture ? "
49027	49121	49019	49020	The painter	366	" Dorian , if I told you , you might like me less than you do , and you would certainly laugh at me . I could not bear your doing either of those two things . If you wish me never to look at your picture again , I am content . I have always you to look at . If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from the world , I am satisfied . Your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation . "
49122	49132	49134	49135	Dorian Gray	115	" No , Basil , you must tell me , "
49137	49147	49134	49135	Dorian Gray	115	" I think I have a right to know . "
49174	49182	49184	49185	the painter	366	" Let us sit down , Dorian , "
49190	49228	49184	49185	the painter	366	" Let us sit down . And just answer me one question . Have you noticed in the picture something curious?-something that probably at first did not strike you , but that revealed itself to you suddenly ? "
49229	49232	49234	49235	the lad	405	" Basil ! "
49255	49996	49234	49235	the lad	405	" I see you did . Do n't speak . Wait till you hear what I have to say . Dorian , from the moment I met you , your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me . I was dominated , soul , brain , and power , by you . You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream . I worshipped you . I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke . I wanted to have you all to myself . I was only happy when I was with you . When you were away from me , you were still present in my art .... Of course , I never let you know anything about this . It would have been impossible . You would not have understood it . I hardly understood it myself . I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face , and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes - too wonderful , perhaps , for in such mad worships there is peril , the peril of losing them , no less than the peril of keeping them .... Weeks and weeks went on , and I grew more and more absorbed in you . Then came a new development . I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour , and as Adonis with huntsman 's cloak and polished boar - spear . Crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian 's barge , gazing across the green turbid Nile . You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the water 's silent silver the marvel of your own face . And it had all been what art should be - unconscious , ideal , and remote . One day , a fatal day I sometimes think , I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . Whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , I can not tell . But I know that as I worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret . I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry . I felt , Dorian , that I had told too much , that I had put too much of myself into it . Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited . You were a little annoyed ; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me . Harry , to whom I talked about it , laughed at me . But I did not mind that . When the picture was finished , and I sat alone with it , I felt that I was right .... Well , after a few days the thing left my studio , and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence , it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it , more than that you were extremely good - looking and that I could paint . Even now I can not help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates . Art is always more abstract than we fancy . Form and colour tell us of form and colour - that is all . It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him . And so when I got this offer from Paris , I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition . It never occurred to me that you would refuse . I see now that you were right . The picture can not be shown . You must not be angry with me , Dorian , for what I have told you . As I said to Harry , once , you are made to be worshipped . "
50125	50134	50136	50136	Hallward	113	" It is extraordinary to me , Dorian , "
50138	50155	50136	50136	Hallward	113	" that you should have seen this in the portrait . Did you really see it ? "
50156	50163	50164	50164	he	113	" I saw something in it , "
50167	50176	50164	50164	he	113	" something that seemed to me very curious . "
50177	50191	50136	50136	Hallward	113	" Well , you do n't mind my looking at the thing now ? "
50197	50220	50192	50192	Dorian	115	" You must not ask me that , Basil . I could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture . "
50221	50229	50136	50136	Hallward	113	" You will some day , surely ? "
50230	50233	50192	50192	Dorian	115	" Never . "
50234	50299	50136	50136	Hallward	113	" Well , perhaps you are right . And now good - bye , Dorian . You have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art . Whatever I have done that is good , I owe to you . Ah ! you do n't know what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you . "
50300	50305	50307	50307	Dorian	115	" My dear Basil , "
50309	50334	50307	50307	Dorian	115	" what have you told me ? Simply that you felt that you admired me too much . That is not even a compliment . "
50335	50376	50136	50136	Hallward	113	" It was not intended as a compliment . It was a confession . Now that I have made it , something seems to have gone out of me . Perhaps one should never put one 's worship into words . "
50377	50385	50307	50307	Dorian	115	" It was a very disappointing confession . "
50386	50416	50136	50136	Hallward	113	" Why , what did you expect , Dorian ? You did n't see anything else in the picture , did you ? There was nothing else to see ? "
50417	50459	50307	50307	Dorian	115	" No ; there was nothing else to see . Why do you ask ? But you must n't talk about worship . It is foolish . You and I are friends , Basil , and we must always remain so . "
50460	50466	50468	50469	the painter	366	" You have got Harry , "
50472	50477	50479	50480	the lad	405	" Oh , Harry ! "
50488	50544	50479	50480	the lad	405	" Harry spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is improbable . Just the sort of life I would like to lead . But still I do n't think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble . I would sooner go to you , Basil . "
50545	50553	50307	50307	Dorian	115	" You will sit to me again ? "
50554	50557	50479	50480	the lad	405	" Impossible ! "
50558	50584	50307	50307	Dorian	115	" You spoil my life as an artist by refusing , Dorian . No man comes across two ideal things . Few come across one . "
50585	50637	50479	50480	the lad	405	" I ca n't explain it to you , Basil , but I must never sit to you again . There is something fatal about a portrait . It has a life of its own . I will come and have tea with you . That will be just as pleasant . "
50638	50647	50649	50649	Hallward	113	" Pleasanter for you , I am afraid , "
50652	50690	50649	50649	Hallward	113	" And now good - bye . I am sorry you wo n't let me look at the picture once again . But that ca n't be helped . I quite understand what you feel about it . "
51063	51071	51072	51072	she	399	" The old schoolroom , Mr. Dorian ? "
51075	51115	51072	51072	she	399	" Why , it is full of dust . I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it . It is not fit for you to see , sir . It is not , indeed . "
51116	51133	51176	51177	his grandfather	972	" I do n't want it put straight , Leaf . I only want the key . "
51134	51169	51072	51072	she	399	" Well , sir , you 'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it . Why , it has n't been opened for nearly five years - not since his lordship died . "
51186	51192	51193	51193	he	1982	" That does not matter , "
51196	51214	51193	51193	he	1982	" I simply want to see the place - that is all . Give me the key . "
51215	51224	51226	51228	the old lady	973	" And here is the key , sir , "
51242	51277	51226	51228	the old lady	973	" Here is the key . I 'll have it off the bunch in a moment . But you do n't think of living up there , sir , and you so comfortable here ? "
51278	51283	51284	51284	he	1982	" No , no , "
51288	51298	51284	51284	he	1982	" Thank you , Leaf . That will do . "
51861	51869	51853	51853	He	1982	" The persons are here , Monsieur . "
51952	51958	51959	51959	he	1982	" Wait for an answer , "
51967	51975	51959	51959	he	1982	" and show the men in here . "
52094	52105	52106	52106	he	115	" What can I do for you , Mr. Gray ? "
52115	52169	52106	52106	he	115	" I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in person . I have just got a beauty of a frame , sir . Picked it up at a sale . Old Florentine . Came from Fonthill , I believe . Admirably suited for a religious subject , Mr. Gray . "
52170	52252	52345	52345	his	991	" I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round , Mr. Hubbard . I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame - though I do n't go in much at present for religious art - but to - day I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me . It is rather heavy , so I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men . "
52253	52282	52106	52106	he	115	" No trouble at all , Mr. Gray . I am delighted to be of any service to you . Which is the work of art , sir ? "
52283	52286	52288	52288	Dorian	115	" This , "
52295	52321	52288	52288	Dorian	115	" Can you move it , covering and all , just as it is ? I do n't want it to get scratched going upstairs . "
52322	52331	52345	52345	his	991	" There will be no difficulty , sir , "
52363	52378	52345	52345	his	991	" And , now , where shall we carry it to , Mr. Gray ? "
52379	52433	52434	52434	He	991	" I will show you the way , Mr. Hubbard , if you will kindly follow me . Or perhaps you had better go in front . I am afraid it is right at the top of the house . We will go up by the front staircase , as it is wider . "
52510	52520	52522	52524	the little man	997	" Something of a load to carry , sir , "
52539	52548	52550	52550	Dorian	115	" I am afraid it is rather heavy , "
53185	53195	53196	53196	he	115	" Bring it in , Mr. Hubbard , please , "
53204	53221	53196	53196	he	115	" I am sorry I kept you so long . I was thinking of something else . "
53222	53233	53235	53245	the frame - maker , who was still gasping for breath	1019	" Always glad to have a rest , Mr. Gray , "
53247	53256	53235	53245	the frame - maker , who was still gasping for breath	1019	" Where shall we put it , sir ? "
53257	53287	53196	53196	he	115	" Oh , anywhere . Here : this will do . I do n't want to have it hung up . Just lean it against the wall . Thanks . "
53288	53300	53235	53245	the frame - maker , who was still gasping for breath	1019	" Might one look at the work of art , sir ? "
53304	53314	53315	53315	he	115	" It would not interest you , Mr. Hubbard , "
53354	53375	53339	53339	he	115	" I sha n't trouble you any more now . I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round . "
53376	53398	53400	53401	Mr. Hubbard	219	" Not at all , not at all , Mr. Gray . Ever ready to do anything for you , sir . "
54627	54635	54636	54636	he	197	" I am so sorry , Harry , "
54639	54665	54636	54636	he	197	" but really it is entirely your fault . That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the time was going . "
54666	54676	54683	54683	his	1070	" Yes , I thought you would like it , "
54686	54709	54683	54683	his	1070	" I did n't say I liked it , Harry . I said it fascinated me . There is a great difference . "

63392	63489	63385	63385	his	113	" Dorian ! What an extraordinary piece of luck ! I have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine o'clock . Finally I took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed , as he let me out . I am off to Paris by the midnight train , and I particularly wanted to see you before I left . I thought it was you , or rather your fur coat , as you passed me . But I was n't quite sure . Did n't you recognize me ? "
63490	63555	63385	63385	his	113	" In this fog , my dear Basil ? Why , I ca n't even recognize Grosvenor Square . I believe my house is somewhere about here , but I do n't feel at all certain about it . I am sorry you are going away , as I have not seen you for ages . But I suppose you will be back soon ? "
63556	63631	63385	63385	his	113	" No : I am going to be out of England for six months . I intend to take a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture I have in my head . However , it was n't about myself I wanted to talk . Here we are at your door . Let me come in for a moment . I have something to say to you . "
63632	63646	63648	63649	Dorian Gray	115	" I shall be charmed . But wo n't you miss your train ? "
63682	63689	63690	63690	he	113	" I have heaps of time , "
63693	63774	63690	63690	he	113	" The train does n't go till twelve - fifteen , and it is only just eleven . In fact , I was on my way to the club to look for you , when I met you . You see , I sha n't have any delay about luggage , as I have sent on my heavy things . All I have with me is in this bag , and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes . "
63782	63833	63775	63775	Dorian	115	" What a way for a fashionable painter to travel ! A Gladstone bag and an ulster ! Come in , or the fog will get into the house . And mind you do n't talk about anything serious . Nothing is serious nowadays . At least nothing should be . "
63898	63957	64178	64178	his	115	" You see your servant made me quite at home , Dorian . He gave me everything I wanted , including your best gold - tipped cigarettes . He is a most hospitable creature . I like him much better than the Frenchman you used to have . What has become of the Frenchman , by the bye ? "
63963	64098	63958	63958	Dorian	115	" I believe he married Lady Radley 's maid , and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker . _ Anglomanie _ is very fashionable over there now , I hear . It seems silly of the French , does n't it ? But - do you know?-he was not at all a bad servant . I never liked him , but I had nothing to complain about . One often imagines things that are quite absurd . He was really very devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away . Have another brandy - and - soda ? Or would you like hock - and - seltzer ? I always take hock - and - seltzer myself . There is sure to be some in the next room . "
64099	64109	64111	64112	the painter	366	" Thanks , I wo n't have anything more , "
64134	64166	64111	64112	the painter	366	" And now , my dear fellow , I want to speak to you seriously . Do n't frown like that . You make it so much more difficult for me . "
64167	64174	64176	64176	Dorian	115	" What is it all about ? "
64189	64215	64183	64183	himself	115	" I hope it is not about myself . I am tired of myself to - night . I should like to be somebody else . "
64216	64222	64224	64224	Hallward	113	" It is about yourself , "
64231	64249	64226	64226	his	113	" and I must say it to you . I shall only keep you half an hour . "
64257	64262	64263	64263	he	115	" Half an hour ! "
64266	64312	64178	64178	his	115	" It is not much to ask of you , Dorian , and it is entirely for your own sake that I am speaking . I think it right that you should know that the most dreadful things are being said against you in London . "
64313	64349	64226	64226	his	113	" I do n't wish to know anything about them . I love scandals about other people , but scandals about myself do n't interest me . They have not got the charm of novelty . "
64350	64949	64178	64178	his	115	" They must interest you , Dorian . Every gentleman is interested in his good name . You do n't want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded . Of course , you have your position , and your wealth , and all that kind of thing . But position and wealth are not everything . Mind you , I do n't believe these rumours at all . At least , I ca n't believe them when I see you . Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man 's face . It can not be concealed . People talk sometimes of secret vices . There are no such things . If a wretched man has a vice , it shows itself in the lines of his mouth , the droop of his eyelids , the moulding of his hands even . Somebody - I wo n't mention his name , but you know him - came to me last year to have his portrait done . I had never seen him before , and had never heard anything about him at the time , though I have heard a good deal since . He offered an extravagant price . I refused him . There was something in the shape of his fingers that I hated . I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him . His life is dreadful . But you , Dorian , with your pure , bright , innocent face , and your marvellous untroubled youth - I ca n't believe anything against you . And yet I see you very seldom , and you never come down to the studio now , and when I am away from you , and I hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you , I do n't know what to say . Why is it , Dorian , that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it ? Why is it that so many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs ? You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley . I met him at dinner last week . Your name happened to come up in conversation , in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley . Staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes , but that you were a man whom no pure - minded girl should be allowed to know , and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with . I reminded him that I was a friend of yours , and asked him what he meant . He told me . He told me right out before everybody . It was horrible ! Why is your friendship so fatal to young men ? There was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide . You were his great friend . There was Sir Henry Ashton , who had to leave England with a tarnished name . You and he were inseparable . What about Adrian Singleton and his dreadful end ? What about Lord Kent 's only son and his career ? I met his father yesterday in St. James 's Street . He seemed broken with shame and sorrow . What about the young Duke of Perth ? What sort of life has he got now ? What gentleman would associate with him ? "
64950	64966	64968	64969	Dorian Gray	115	" Stop , Basil . You are talking about things of which you know nothing , "
64986	65208	64983	64983	his	115	" You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it . It is because I know everything about his life , not because he knows anything about mine . With such blood as he has in his veins , how could his record be clean ? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth . Did I teach the one his vices , and the other his debauchery ? If Kent 's silly son takes his wife from the streets , what is that to me ? If Adrian Singleton writes his friend 's name across a bill , am I his keeper ? I know how people chatter in England . The middle classes air their moral prejudices over their gross dinner - tables , and whisper about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with the people they slander . In this country , it is enough for a man to have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him . And what sort of lives do these people , who pose as being moral , lead themselves ? My dear fellow , you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite . "
65209	65212	65214	65214	Hallward	113	" Dorian , "
65216	65368	65214	65214	Hallward	113	" that is not the question . England is bad enough I know , and English society is all wrong . That is the reason why I want you to be fine . You have not been fine . One has a right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends . Yours seem to lose all sense of honour , of goodness , of purity . You have filled them with a madness for pleasure . They have gone down into the depths . You led them there . Yes : you led them there , and yet you can smile , as you are smiling now . And there is worse behind . I know you and Harry are inseparable . Surely for that reason , if for none other , you should not have made his sister 's name a by - word . "
65369	65380	64983	64983	his	115	" Take care , Basil . You go too far . "
65381	65818	65214	65214	Hallward	113	" I must speak , and you must listen . You shall listen . When you met Lady Gwendolen , not a breath of scandal had ever touched her . Is there a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park ? Why , even her children are not allowed to live with her . Then there are other stories - stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in London . Are they true ? Can they be true ? When I first heard them , I laughed . I hear them now , and they make me shudder . What about your country - house and the life that is led there ? Dorian , you do n't know what is said about you . I wo n't tell you that I do n't want to preach to you . I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that , and then proceeded to break his word . I do want to preach to you . I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you . I want you to have a clean name and a fair record . I want you to get rid of the dreadful people you associate with . Do n't shrug your shoulders like that . Do n't be so indifferent . You have a wonderful influence . Let it be for good , not for evil . They say that you corrupt every one with whom you become intimate , and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after . I do n't know whether it is so or not . How should I know ? But it is said of you . I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt . Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford . He showed me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone . Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read . I told him that it was absurd - that I knew you thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind . Know you ? I wonder do I know you ? Before I could answer that , I should have to see your soul . "
65819	65825	65827	65828	Dorian Gray	115	" To see my soul ! "
65842	65845	65847	65847	Hallward	113	" Yes , "
65860	65873	65857	65857	his	113	" to see your soul . But only God can do that . "
65888	65899	65900	65900	he	113	" You shall see it yourself , to - night ! "
65910	66003	65900	65900	he	113	" Come : it is your own handiwork . Why should n't you look at it ? You can tell the world all about it afterwards , if you choose . Nobody would believe you . If they did believe you , they would like me all the better for it . I know the age better than you do , though you will prate about it so tediously . Come , I tell you . You have chattered enough about corruption . Now you shall look on it face to face . "
66084	66087	66088	66088	he	113	" Yes , "
66103	66124	66088	66088	he	113	" I shall show you my soul . You shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see . "
66129	66136	66137	66137	he	113	" This is blasphemy , Dorian ! "
66140	66160	66137	66137	he	113	" You must not say things like that . They are horrible , and they do n't mean anything . "
66161	66166	66167	66167	He	113	" You think so ? "
66171	66206	66167	66167	He	113	" I know so . As for what I said to you to - night , I said it for your good . You know I have been always a stanch friend to you . "
66207	66220	66137	66137	he	113	" Do n't touch me . Finish what you have to say . "
66320	66327	66329	66331	the young man	1365	" I am waiting , Basil , "
66342	66351	66352	66352	he	113	" What I have to say is this , "
66355	66427	66352	66352	he	113	" You must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you . If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end , I shall believe you . Deny them , Dorian , deny them ! Ca n't you see what I am going through ? My God ! do n't tell me that you are bad , and corrupt , and shameful . "
66442	66448	66449	66449	he	113	" Come upstairs , Basil , "
66453	66490	66449	66449	he	113	" I keep a diary of my life from day to day , and it never leaves the room in which it is written . I shall show it to you if you come with me . "
66491	66548	66439	66439	his	113	" I shall come with you , Dorian , if you wish it . I see I have missed my train . That makes no matter . I can go to - morrow . But do n't ask me to read anything to - night . All I want is a plain answer to my question . "
66549	66573	66449	66449	he	113	" That shall be given to you upstairs . I could not give it here . You will not have to read long . "
66651	66659	66660	66660	he	115	" You insist on knowing , Basil ? "
66667	66670	66660	66660	he	115	" Yes . "
66671	66676	66677	66677	he	115	" I am delighted , "
66689	66719	66683	66683	he	115	" You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me . You have had more to do with my life than you think "
66762	66769	66770	66770	he	115	" Shut the door behind you , "
66896	66923	66947	66947	Hallward	113	" So you think that it is only God who sees the soul , Basil ? Draw that curtain back , and you will see mine . "
66933	66945	66947	66947	Hallward	113	" You are mad , Dorian , or playing a part , "
66951	66963	66970	66970	he	1365	" You wo n't ? Then I must do it myself , "
67366	67372	67374	67374	Hallward	113	" What does this mean ? "
67390	67400	67402	67403	Dorian Gray	115	" Years ago , when I was a boy , "
67412	67499	67402	67403	Dorian Gray	115	" you met me , flattered me , and taught me to be vain of my good looks . One day you introduced me to a friend of yours , who explained to me the wonder of youth , and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty . In a mad moment that , even now , I do n't know whether I regret or not , I made a wish , perhaps you would call it a prayer .... "
67500	67552	67379	67379	His	113	" I remember it ! Oh , how well I remember it ! No ! the thing is impossible . The room is damp . Mildew has got into the canvas . The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them . I tell you the thing is impossible . "
67553	67560	67562	67564	the young man	1365	" Ah , what is impossible ? "
67584	67593	67379	67379	His	113	" You told me you had destroyed it . "
67594	67604	67379	67379	His	113	" I was wrong . It has destroyed me . "
67605	67615	67379	67379	His	113	" I do n't believe it is my picture . "
67616	67626	67628	67628	Dorian	115	" Ca n't you see your ideal in it ? "
67631	67640	67379	67379	His	113	" My ideal , as you call it ... "
67641	67647	67379	67379	His	113	" As you called it . "
67648	67681	67379	67379	His	113	" There was nothing evil in it , nothing shameful . You were to me such an ideal as I shall never meet again . This is the face of a satyr . "
67682	67691	67379	67379	His	113	" It is the face of my soul . "
67692	67711	67379	67379	His	113	" Christ ! what a thing I must have worshipped ! It has the eyes of a devil . "
67712	67725	67727	67727	Dorian	115	" Each of us has heaven and hell in him , Basil , "
67746	67755	67756	67756	he	113	" My God ! If it is true , "
67759	67789	67756	67756	he	113	" and this is what you have done with your life , why , you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to be ! "
67916	67931	67895	67895	he	113	" Good God , Dorian , what a lesson ! What an awful lesson ! "
67949	67956	67957	67957	he	113	" Pray , Dorian , pray , "
67960	68041	67957	67957	he	113	" What is it that one was taught to say in one 's boyhood ? ' Lead us not into temptation . Forgive us our sins . Wash away our iniquities . ' Let us say that together . The prayer of your pride has been answered . The prayer of your repentance will be answered also . I worshipped you too much . I am punished for it . You worshipped yourself too much . We are both punished . "
68057	68065	68066	68066	he	115	" It is too late , Basil , "
68069	68118	68042	68043	Dorian Gray	115	" It is never too late , Dorian . Let us kneel down and try if we can not remember a prayer . Is n't there a verse somewhere , ' Though your sins be as scarlet , yet I will make them as white as snow ' ? "
68119	68128	68042	68043	Dorian Gray	115	" Those words mean nothing to me now . "
68129	68160	68042	68043	Dorian Gray	115	" Hush ! Do n't say that . You have done enough evil in your life . My God ! Do n't you see that accursed thing leering at us ? "
69315	69329	69330	69330	he	484	" I am sorry to have had to wake you up , Francis , "
69336	69351	69330	69330	he	484	" but I had forgotten my latch - key . What time is it ? "
69352	69360	69362	69363	the man	1982	" Ten minutes past two , sir , "
69372	69399	69293	69293	he	113	" Ten minutes past two ? How horribly late ! You must wake me at nine to - morrow . I have some work to do . "
69400	69406	69330	69330	he	484	" All right , sir . "
69407	69415	69293	69293	he	113	" Did any one call this evening ? "
69416	69438	69330	69330	he	484	" Mr. Hallward , sir . He stayed here till eleven , and then he went away to catch his train . "
69439	69457	69293	69293	he	113	" Oh ! I am sorry I did n't see him . Did he leave any message ? "
69458	69483	69330	69330	he	484	" No , sir , except that he would write to you from Paris , if he did not find you at the club . "
69484	69503	69293	69293	he	113	" That will do , Francis . Do n't forget to call me at nine to - morrow . "
69504	69509	69330	69330	he	484	" No , sir . "
69576	69587	69557	69557	he	115	" Alan Campbell , 152 , Hertford Street , Mayfair . "

71958	71982	71933	71933	his	307	" Yes : it is a matter of life and death , Alan , and to more than one person . Sit down . "
72058	72140	72032	72032	he	115	" Alan , in a locked room at the top of this house , a room to which nobody but myself has access , a dead man is seated at a table . He has been dead ten hours now . Do n't stir , and do n't look at me like that . Who the man is , why he died , how he died , are matters that do not concern you . What you have to do is this- "
72141	72197	72032	72032	he	115	" Stop , Gray . I do n't want to know anything further . Whether what you have told me is true or not true does n't concern me . I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life . Keep your horrible secrets to yourself . They do n't interest me any more . "
72198	72384	72032	72032	he	115	" Alan , they will have to interest you . This one will have to interest you . I am awfully sorry for you , Alan . But I ca n't help myself . You are the one man who is able to save me . I am forced to bring you into the matter . I have no option . Alan , you are scientific . You know about chemistry and things of that kind . You have made experiments . What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs - to destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left . Nobody saw this person come into the house . Indeed , at the present moment he is supposed to be in Paris . He will not be missed for months . When he is missed , there must be no trace of him found here . You , Alan , you must change him , and everything that belongs to him , into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air . "
72385	72392	72032	72032	he	115	" You are mad , Dorian . "
72393	72406	72032	72032	he	115	" Ah ! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian . "
72407	72477	72032	72032	he	115	" You are mad , I tell you - mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you , mad to make this monstrous confession . I will have nothing to do with this matter , whatever it is . Do you think I am going to peril my reputation for you ? What is it to me what devil 's work you are up to ? "
72478	72485	72032	72032	he	115	" It was suicide , Alan . "
72486	72506	72032	72032	he	115	" I am glad of that . But who drove him to it ? You , I should fancy . "
72507	72518	72032	72032	he	115	" Do you still refuse to do this for me ? "
72519	72650	72032	72032	he	115	" Of course I refuse . I will have absolutely nothing to do with it . I do n't care what shame comes on you . You deserve it all . I should not be sorry to see you disgraced , publicly disgraced . How dare you ask me , of all men in the world , to mix myself up in this horror ? I should have thought you knew more about people 's characters . Your friend Lord Henry Wotton ca n't have taught you much about psychology , whatever else he has taught you . Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you . You have come to the wrong man . Go to some of your friends . Do n't come to me . "
72651	72710	72032	72032	he	115	" Alan , it was murder . I killed him . You do n't know what he had made me suffer . Whatever my life is , he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than poor Harry has had . He may not have intended it , the result was the same . "
72711	72776	72032	72032	he	115	" Murder ! Good God , Dorian , is that what you have come to ? I shall not inform upon you . It is not my business . Besides , without my stirring in the matter , you are certain to be arrested . Nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid . But I will have nothing to do with it . "
72777	73005	72032	72032	he	115	" You must have something to do with it . Wait , wait a moment ; listen to me . Only listen , Alan . All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment . You go to hospitals and dead - houses , and the horrors that you do there do n't affect you . If in some hideous dissecting - room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through , you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject . You would not turn a hair . You would not believe that you were doing anything wrong . On the contrary , you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race , or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world , or gratifying intellectual curiosity , or something of that kind . What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before . Indeed , to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at . And , remember , it is the only piece of evidence against me . If it is discovered , I am lost ; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me . "
73006	73036	72032	72032	he	115	" I have no desire to help you . You forget that . I am simply indifferent to the whole thing . It has nothing to do with me . "
73037	73136	72032	72032	he	115	" Alan , I entreat you . Think of the position I am in . Just before you came I almost fainted with terror . You may know terror yourself some day . No ! do n't think of that . Look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view . You do n't inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from . Do n't inquire now . I have told you too much as it is . But I beg of you to do this . We were friends once , Alan . "
73137	73151	72032	72032	he	115	" Do n't speak about those days , Dorian - they are dead . "
73152	73220	72032	72032	he	115	" The dead linger sometimes . The man upstairs will not go away . He is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms . Alan ! Alan ! If you do n't come to my assistance , I am ruined . Why , they will hang me , Alan ! Do n't you understand ? They will hang me for what I have done . "
73221	73250	72032	72032	he	115	" There is no good in prolonging this scene . I absolutely refuse to do anything in the matter . It is insane of you to ask me . "
73251	73255	72032	72032	he	115	" You refuse ? "
73256	73259	72032	72032	he	115	" Yes . "
73260	73267	72032	72032	he	115	" I entreat you , Alan . "
73268	73273	72032	72032	he	115	" It is useless . "
73423	73433	73434	73434	he	115	" I am so sorry for you , Alan , "
73437	73569	73434	73434	he	115	" but you leave me no alternative . I have a letter written already . Here it is . You see the address . If you do n't help me , I must send it . If you do n't help me , I will send it . You know what the result will be . But you are going to help me . It is impossible for you to refuse now . I tried to spare you . You will do me the justice to admit that . You were stern , harsh , offensive . You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me - no living man , at any rate . I bore it all . Now it is for me to dictate terms . "
73585	73634	73570	73570	Campbell	307	" Yes , it is my turn to dictate terms , Alan . You know what they are . The thing is quite simple . Come , do n't work yourself into this fever . The thing has to be done . Face it , and do it . "
73731	73742	73777	73777	He	307	" Come , Alan , you must decide at once . "
73743	73750	73751	73751	he	307	" I can not do it , "
73763	73776	73751	73751	he	307	" You must . You have no choice . Do n't delay . "
73782	73792	73777	73777	He	307	" Is there a fire in the room upstairs ? "
73793	73805	73777	73777	He	307	" Yes , there is a gas - fire with asbestos . "
73806	73821	73777	73777	He	307	" I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory . "
73822	73859	73777	73777	He	307	" No , Alan , you must not leave the house . Write out on a sheet of notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the things back to you . "
74026	74034	74035	74035	he	307	" You are infamous , absolutely infamous ! "
74038	74049	74051	74051	Dorian	115	" Hush , Alan . You have saved my life , "
74053	74109	74001	74001	his	307	" Your life ? Good heavens ! what a life that is ! You have gone from corruption to corruption , and now you have culminated in crime . In doing what I am going to do - what you force me to do - it is not of your life that I am thinking . "
74110	74115	74117	74117	Dorian	115	" Ah , Alan , "
74122	74141	74142	74142	He	307	" I wish you had a thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you . "
74202	74212	74213	74213	he	307	" Shall I leave the things here , sir ? "
74217	74220	74222	74222	Dorian	115	" Yes , "
74224	74255	74222	74222	Dorian	115	" And I am afraid , Francis , that I have another errand for you . What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies Selby with orchids ? "
74256	74261	74173	74174	the servant	1479	" Harden , sir . "
74262	74339	74222	74222	Dorian	115	" Yes - Harden . You must go down to Richmond at once , see Harden personally , and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered , and to have as few white ones as possible . In fact , I do n't want any white ones . It is a lovely day , Francis , and Richmond is a very pretty place - otherwise I would n't bother you about it . "
74340	74354	74173	74174	the servant	1479	" No trouble , sir . At what time shall I be back ? "
74360	74370	74371	74371	he	307	" How long will your experiment take , Alan ? "
74402	74410	74411	74411	he	307	" It will take about five hours , "
74414	74468	74518	74518	He	1982	" It will be time enough , then , if you are back at half - past seven , Francis . Or stay : just leave my things out for dressing . You can have the evening to yourself . I am not dining at home , so I shall not want you . "
74469	74475	74477	74478	the man	1982	" Thank you , sir , "
74484	74517	74518	74518	He	1982	" Now , Alan , there is not a moment to be lost . How heavy this chest is ! I 'll take it for you . You bring the other things . "
74574	74586	74587	74587	he	115	" I do n't think I can go in , Alan , "
74590	74603	74605	74605	Campbell	307	" It is nothing to me . I do n't require you , "
74905	74910	74918	74918	He	115	" Leave me now , "
74985	74996	74997	74997	he	115	" I have done what you asked me to do , "
75000	75016	74997	74997	he	115	" And now , good - bye . Let us never see each other again . "
75017	75033	75035	75035	Dorian	115	" You have saved me from ruin , Alan . I can not forget that , "
75375	75392	75393	75393	she	316	" I know , my dear , I should have fallen madly in love with you , "
75398	75489	75393	75393	she	316	" and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake . It is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time . As it was , our bonnets were so unbecoming , and the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind , that I never had even a flirtation with anybody . However , that was all Narborough 's fault . He was dreadfully short - sighted , and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who never sees anything . "
75544	75557	75558	75558	she	316	" I think it is most unkind of her , my dear , "
75561	75690	75558	75558	she	316	" Of course I go and stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg , but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes , and besides , I really wake them up . You do n't know what an existence they lead down there . It is pure unadulterated country life . They get up early , because they have so much to do , and go to bed early , because they have so little to think about . There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of Queen Elizabeth , and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner . You sha n't sit next either of them . You shall sit by me and amuse me . "
75916	75945	75892	75893	Lady Narborough	316	" How horrid of Henry Wotton to be so late ! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised faithfully not to disappoint me . "
76007	76024	76005	76005	she	316	" an insult to poor Adolphe , who invented the _ menu _ specially for you , "
76067	76070	76072	76073	Lord Henry	112	" Dorian , "
76089	76107	76072	76073	Lord Henry	112	" what is the matter with you to - night ? You are quite out of sorts . "
76108	76116	76118	76119	Lady Narborough	316	" I believe he is in love , "
76121	76146	76118	76119	Lady Narborough	316	" and that he is afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous . He is quite right . I certainly should . "
76147	76152	76154	76154	Dorian	115	" Dear Lady Narborough , "
76158	76182	76154	76154	Dorian	115	" I have not been in love for a whole week - not , in fact , since Madame de Ferrol left town . "
76183	76195	76197	76199	the old lady	973	" How you men can fall in love with that woman ! "
76201	76209	76197	76199	the old lady	973	" I really can not understand it . "
76210	76228	76230	76231	Lord Henry	112	" It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl , Lady Narborough , "
76233	76246	76230	76231	Lord Henry	112	" She is the one link between us and your short frocks . "
76247	76282	76197	76199	the old lady	973	" She does not remember my short frocks at all , Lord Henry . But I remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago , and how _ decolletee _ she was then . "
76283	76291	76292	76292	he	112	" She is still _ decolletee _ , "
76303	76360	76299	76299	his	112	" and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an _ edition de luxe _ of a bad French novel . She is really wonderful , and full of surprises . Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary . When her third husband died , her hair turned quite gold from grief . "
76361	76368	76370	76370	Dorian	115	" How can you , Harry ! "
76372	76380	76382	76383	the hostess	1535	" It is a most romantic explanation , "
76385	76405	76382	76383	the hostess	1535	" But her third husband , Lord Henry ! You do n't mean to say Ferrol is the fourth ? "
76406	76412	76299	76299	his	112	" Certainly , Lady Narborough . "
76413	76423	76382	76383	the hostess	1535	" I do n't believe a word of it . "
76424	76440	76299	76299	his	112	" Well , ask Mr. Gray . He is one of her most intimate friends . "
76441	76449	76382	76383	the hostess	1535	" Is it true , Mr. Gray ? "
76450	76459	76461	76461	Dorian	115	" She assures me so , Lady Narborough , "
76463	76503	76461	76461	Dorian	115	" I asked her whether , like Marguerite de Navarre , she had their hearts embalmed and hung at her girdle . She told me she did n't , because none of them had had any hearts at all . "
76504	76519	76382	76383	the hostess	1535	" Four husbands ! Upon my word that is _ trop de zele _ . "
76520	76530	76532	76532	Dorian	115	" _ Trop d'audace _ , I tell her , "
76534	76559	76382	76383	the hostess	1535	" Oh ! she is audacious enough for anything , my dear . And what is Ferrol like ? I do n't know him . "
76560	76573	76575	76576	Lord Henry	112	" The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes , "
76590	76610	76582	76583	Lady Narborough	316	" Lord Henry , I am not at all surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked . "
76611	76618	76620	76621	Lord Henry	112	" But what world says that ? "
76627	76645	76624	76624	his	112	" It can only be the next world . This world and I are on excellent terms . "
76646	76656	76658	76660	the old lady	973	" Everybody I know says you are very wicked , "
76674	76680	76681	76681	he	112	" It is perfectly monstrous , "
76687	76709	76681	76681	he	112	" the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one 's back that are absolutely and entirely true . "
76710	76716	76718	76718	Dorian	115	" Is n't he incorrigible ? "
76726	76731	76733	76734	his hostess	1497	" I hope so , "
76738	76768	76733	76734	his hostess	1497	" But really , if you all worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way , I shall have to marry again so as to be in the fashion . "
76769	76779	76782	76783	Lord Henry	112	" You will never marry again , Lady Narborough , "
76785	76831	76782	76783	Lord Henry	112	" You were far too happy . When a woman marries again , it is because she detested her first husband . When a man marries again , it is because he adored his first wife . Women try their luck ; men risk theirs . "
76832	76838	76840	76842	the old lady	973	" Narborough was n't perfect , "
76844	76861	76863	76864	the rejoinder	1539	" If he had been , you would not have loved him , my dear lady , "
76866	76916	76863	76864	the rejoinder	1539	" Women love us for our defects . If we have enough of them , they will forgive us everything , even our intellects . You will never ask me to dinner again after saying this , I am afraid , Lady Narborough , but it is quite true . "
76917	76990	77012	77013	his hostess	1497	" Of course it is true , Lord Henry . If we women did not love you for your defects , where would you all be ? Not one of you would ever be married . You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors . Not , however , that that would alter you much . Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors , and all the bachelors like married men . "
76991	76998	77000	77001	Lord Henry	112	" _ Fin de siecle _ , "
77003	77010	77012	77013	his hostess	1497	" _ Fin du globe _ , "
77015	77026	77028	77028	Dorian	115	" I wish it were _ fin du globe _ , "
77033	77040	77028	77028	Dorian	115	" Life is a great disappointment . "
77041	77047	77049	77050	Lady Narborough	316	" Ah , my dear , "
77057	77131	77054	77054	her	316	" do n't tell me that you have exhausted life . When a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him . Lord Henry is very wicked , and I sometimes wish that I had been ; but you are made to be good - you look so good . I must find you a nice wife . Lord Henry , do n't you think that Mr. Gray should get married ? "
77132	77143	77145	77146	Lord Henry	112	" I am always telling him so , Lady Narborough , "
77151	77186	77054	77054	her	316	" Well , we must look out for a suitable match for him . I shall go through Debrett carefully to - night and draw out a list of all the eligible young ladies . "
77187	77195	77197	77197	Dorian	115	" With their ages , Lady Narborough ? "
77199	77244	77197	77197	Dorian	115	" Of course , with their ages , slightly edited . But nothing must be done in a hurry . I want it to be what _ The Morning Post _ calls a suitable alliance , and I want you both to be happy . "
77245	77254	77256	77257	Lord Henry	112	" What nonsense people talk about happy marriages ! "
77259	77278	77256	77257	Lord Henry	112	" A man can be happy with any woman , as long as he does not love her . "
77279	77288	77290	77292	the old lady	973	" Ah ! what a cynic you are ! "
77304	77355	77301	77302	Lady Ruxton	318	" You must come and dine with me soon again . You are really an admirable tonic , much better than what Sir Andrew prescribes for me . You must tell me what people you would like to meet , though . I want it to be a delightful gathering . "
77356	77371	77372	77372	he	1542	" I like men who have a future and women who have a past , "
77375	77388	77372	77372	he	1542	" Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party ? "
77389	77394	77395	77395	she	973	" I fear so , "
77405	77415	77416	77416	she	973	" A thousand pardons , my dear Lady Ruxton , "
77419	77431	77416	77416	she	973	" I did n't see you had n't finished your cigarette . "
77432	77458	77498	77499	Lady Ruxton	318	" Never mind , Lady Narborough . I smoke a great deal too much . I am going to limit myself , for the future . "
77459	77467	77469	77470	Lord Henry	112	" Pray do n't , Lady Ruxton , "
77472	77497	77469	77470	Lord Henry	112	" Moderation is a fatal thing . Enough is as bad as a meal . More than enough is as good as a feast . "
77505	77526	77527	77527	she	973	" You must come and explain that to me some afternoon , Lord Henry . It sounds a fascinating theory , "
77538	77554	77556	77557	Lady Narborough	316	" Now , mind you do n't stay too long over your politics and scandal , "
77562	77574	77556	77557	Lady Narborough	316	" If you do , we are sure to squabble upstairs . "
77720	77729	77730	77730	he	112	" Are you better , my dear fellow ? "
77733	77743	77730	77730	he	112	" You seemed rather out of sorts at dinner . "
77744	77760	77712	77712	he	112	" I am quite well , Harry . I am tired . That is all . "
77761	77787	77730	77730	he	112	" You were charming last night . The little duchess is quite devoted to you . She tells me she is going down to Selby . "
77788	77798	77712	77712	he	112	" She has promised to come on the twentieth . "
77799	77808	77730	77730	he	112	" Is Monmouth to be there , too ? "
77809	77816	77712	77712	he	112	" Oh , yes , Harry . "
77817	77909	77730	77730	he	112	" He bores me dreadfully , almost as much as he bores her . She is very clever , too clever for a woman . She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness . It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious . Her feet are very pretty , but they are not feet of clay . White porcelain feet , if you like . They have been through the fire , and what fire does not destroy , it hardens . She has had experiences . "
77910	77918	77920	77920	Dorian	115	" How long has she been married ? "
77922	77964	77730	77730	he	112	" An eternity , she tells me . I believe , according to the peerage , it is ten years , but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity , with time thrown in . Who else is coming ? "
77965	77993	77730	77730	he	112	" Oh , the Willoughbys , Lord Rugby and his wife , our hostess , Geoffrey Clouston , the usual set . I have asked Lord Grotrian . "
77994	77999	78001	78002	Lord Henry	112	" I like him , "
78004	78040	78001	78002	Lord Henry	112	" A great many people do n't , but I find him charming . He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over - educated . He is a very modern type . "
78041	78068	77730	77730	he	112	" I do n't know if he will be able to come , Harry . He may have to go to Monte Carlo with his father . "
78069	78117	78001	78002	Lord Henry	112	" Ah ! what a nuisance people 's people are ! Try and make him come . By the way , Dorian , you ran off very early last night . You left before eleven . What did you do afterwards ? Did you go straight home ? "
78126	78131	78132	78132	he	115	" No , Harry , "
78137	78147	78132	78132	he	115	" I did not get home till nearly three . "
78148	78156	77730	77730	he	112	" Did you go to the club ? "
78157	78160	78161	78161	he	115	" Yes , "
78170	78278	78165	78165	he	115	" No , I do n't mean that . I did n't go to the club . I walked about . I forget what I did .... How inquisitive you are , Harry ! You always want to know what one has been doing . I always want to forget what I have been doing . I came in at half - past two , if you wish to know the exact time . I had left my latch - key at home , and my servant had to let me in . If you want any corroborative evidence on the subject , you can ask him . "
78285	78336	78279	78280	Lord Henry	112	" My dear fellow , as if I cared ! Let us go up to the drawing - room . No sherry , thank you , Mr. Chapman . Something has happened to you , Dorian . Tell me what it is . You are not yourself to - night . "
78337	78392	78279	78280	Lord Henry	112	" Do n't mind me , Harry . I am irritable , and out of temper . I shall come round and see you to - morrow , or next day . Make my excuses to Lady Narborough . I sha n't go upstairs . I shall go home . I must go home . "
78393	78419	78466	78467	Lord Henry	112	" All right , Dorian . I dare say I shall see you to - morrow at tea - time . The duchess is coming . "
78420	78430	78431	78431	he	1549	" I will try to be there , Harry , "
78976	78984	78985	78985	he	1982	" It is too far for me , "
78988	78996	78998	78998	Dorian	115	" Here is a sovereign for you , "
79000	79010	78998	78998	Dorian	115	" You shall have another if you drive fast . "
79011	79017	79019	79020	the man	1982	" All right , sir , "
79022	79031	79019	79020	the man	1982	" you will be there in an hour , "
79166	79186	79145	79145	he	115	" To cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul . "
79324	79344	79371	79371	it	1574	" To cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul ! "
80011	80022	80023	80023	he	1982	" Somewhere about here , sir , ai n't it ? "
80036	80041	80042	80042	he	115	" This will do , "
80418	80429	80431	80433	one of them	1617	" He thinks he 's got red ants on him , "
80535	80541	80543	80543	Dorian	115	" You here , Adrian ? "
80545	80552	80553	80553	he	115	" Where else should I be ? "
80558	80569	80553	80553	he	115	" None of the chaps will speak to me now . "
80570	80578	80501	80501	he	115	" I thought you had left England . "
80579	80609	80610	80610	he	115	" Darlington is not going to do anything . My brother paid the bill at last . George does n't speak to me either .... I do n't care , "
80616	80640	80610	80610	he	115	" As long as one has this stuff , one does n't want friends . I think I have had too many friends . "
80781	80791	80792	80792	he	115	" I am going on to the other place , "
80798	80803	80792	80792	he	115	" On the wharf ? "
80804	80807	80792	80792	he	115	" Yes . "
80808	80829	80792	80792	he	115	" That mad - cat is sure to be there . They wo n't have her in this place now . "
80835	80861	80830	80830	Dorian	115	" I am sick of women who love one . Women who hate one are much more interesting . Besides , the stuff is better . "
80862	80867	80792	80792	he	115	" Much the same . "
80868	80886	80830	80830	Dorian	115	" I like it better . Come and have something to drink . I must have something . "
80887	80894	80896	80898	the young man	1365	" I do n't want anything , "
80900	80904	80896	80898	the young man	1365	" Never mind . "
80995	81004	81005	81005	she	1630	" We are very proud to - night , "
81008	81019	81021	81021	Dorian	115	" For God 's sake do n't talk to me , "
81030	81050	81021	81021	Dorian	115	" What do you want ? Money ? Here it is . Do n't ever talk to me again . "
81096	81102	81104	81105	Adrian Singleton	215	" It 's no use , "
81107	81127	81104	81105	Adrian Singleton	215	" I do n't care to go back . What does it matter ? I am quite happy here . "
81128	81143	81145	81145	Dorian	115	" You will write to me if you want anything , wo n't you ? "
81151	81154	81104	81105	Adrian Singleton	215	" Perhaps . "
81155	81161	81104	81105	Adrian Singleton	215	" Good night , then . "
81162	81166	81168	81170	the young man	1365	" Good night , "
81223	81231	81232	81232	she	1635	" There goes the devil 's bargain ! "
81240	81244	81245	81245	he	115	" Curse you ! "
81248	81255	81245	81245	he	115	" do n't call me that . "
81261	81276	81277	81277	she	1635	" Prince Charming is what you like to be called , ai n't it ? "
81765	81771	81772	81772	he	115	" What do you want ? "
81775	81779	81781	81782	the man	1982	" Keep quiet , "
81784	81793	81781	81782	the man	1982	" If you stir , I shoot you . "
81794	81806	81781	81782	the man	1982	" You are mad . What have I done to you ? "
81807	81816	81781	81782	the man	1982	" You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane , "
81821	81919	81781	81782	the man	1982	" and Sibyl Vane was my sister . She killed herself . I know it . Her death is at your door . I swore I would kill you in return . For years I have sought you . I had no clue , no trace . The two people who could have described you were dead . I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you . I heard it to - night by chance . Make your peace with God , for to - night you are going to die . "
81927	81933	81934	81934	he	115	" I never knew her , "
81937	81948	81934	81934	he	115	" I never heard of her . You are mad . "
81949	81972	81997	81998	the man	1982	" You had better confess your sin , for as sure as I am James Vane , you are going to die . "
81989	81995	81997	81998	the man	1982	" Down on your knees ! "
82000	82039	81997	81998	the man	1982	" I give you one minute to make your peace - no more . I go on board to - night for India , and I must do my job first . One minute . That 's all . "
82069	82072	82073	82073	he	115	" Stop , "
82076	82092	82073	82073	he	115	" How long ago is it since your sister died ? Quick , tell me ! "
82093	82097	82099	82100	the man	1982	" Eighteen years , "
82102	82114	82099	82100	the man	1982	" Why do you ask me ? What do years matter ? "
82115	82119	82130	82130	his	115	" Eighteen years , "
82133	82148	82130	82130	his	115	" Eighteen years ! Set me under the lamp and look at my face ! "
82287	82294	82295	82295	he	115	" My God ! my God ! "
82298	82306	82295	82295	he	115	" and I would have murdered you ! "
82314	82330	82331	82331	he	115	" You have been on the brink of committing a terrible crime , my man , "
82339	82356	82331	82331	he	115	" Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own hands . "
82357	82363	82365	82366	James Vane	183	" Forgive me , sir , "
82368	82389	82365	82366	James Vane	183	" I was deceived . A chance word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track . "
82390	82409	82411	82411	Dorian	115	" You had better go home and put that pistol away , or you may get into trouble , "
82500	82508	82509	82509	she	1665	" Why did n't you kill him ? "
82521	82559	82509	82509	she	1665	" I knew you were following him when you rushed out from Daly 's . You fool ! You should have killed him . He has lots of money , and he 's as bad as bad . "
82560	82571	82572	82572	he	183	" He is not the man I am looking for , "
82575	82625	82509	82509	she	1665	" and I want no man 's money . I want a man 's life . The man whose life I want must be nearly forty now . This one is little more than a boy . Thank God , I have not got his blood upon my hands . "
82633	82640	82641	82641	she	747	" Little more than a boy ! "
82644	82664	82641	82641	she	747	" Why , man , it 's nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me what I am . "
82665	82669	82671	82672	James Vane	183	" You lie ! "
82682	82691	82692	82692	she	747	" Before God I am telling the truth , "
82695	82699	82641	82641	she	747	" Before God ? "
82700	82757	82758	82758	she	747	" Strike me dumb if it ai n't so . He is the worst one that comes here . They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face . It 's nigh on eighteen years since I met him . He has n't changed much since then . I have , though , "
82766	82771	82641	82641	she	747	" You swear this ? "
82772	82777	82783	82783	her	747	" I swear it , "
82787	82797	82798	82798	she	747	" But do n't give me away to him , "
82801	82819	82798	82798	she	747	" I am afraid of him . Let me have some money for my night 's lodging . "
83048	83056	83058	83059	Lord Henry	112	" What are you two talking about ? "
83072	83094	83058	83059	Lord Henry	112	" I hope Dorian has told you about my plan for rechristening everything , Gladys . It is a delightful idea . "
83095	83107	83109	83110	the duchess	547	" But I do n't want to be rechristened , Harry , "
83121	83143	83117	83117	her	547	" I am quite satisfied with my own name , and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his . "
83144	83306	83058	83059	Lord Henry	112	" My dear Gladys , I would not alter either name for the world . They are both perfect . I was thinking chiefly of flowers . Yesterday I cut an orchid , for my button - hole . It was a marvellous spotted thing , as effective as the seven deadly sins . In a thoughtless moment I asked one of the gardeners what it was called . He told me it was a fine specimen of _ Robinsoniana _ , or something dreadful of that kind . It is a sad truth , but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things . Names are everything . I never quarrel with actions . My one quarrel is with words . That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature . The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one . It is the only thing he is fit for . "
83307	83317	83318	83318	she	1685	" Then what should we call you , Harry ? "
83321	83328	83330	83330	Dorian	115	" His name is Prince Paradox , "
83332	83340	83342	83343	the duchess	547	" I recognize him in a flash , "
83345	83353	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" I wo n't hear of it , "
83363	83377	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" From a label there is no escape ! I refuse the title . "
83378	83384	83342	83343	the duchess	547	" Royalties may not abdicate , "
83393	83404	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" You wish me to defend my throne , then ? "
83405	83408	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Yes . "
83409	83419	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" I give the truths of to - morrow . "
83420	83430	83431	83431	she	1685	" I prefer the mistakes of to - day , "
83434	83441	83442	83442	he	112	" You disarm me , Gladys , "
83452	83464	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Of your shield , Harry , not of your spear . "
83465	83472	83473	83473	he	112	" I never tilt against beauty , "
83483	83501	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" That is your error , Harry , believe me . You value beauty far too much . "
83502	83554	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" How can you say that ? I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good . But on the other hand , no one is more ready than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly . "
83555	83567	83569	83570	the duchess	547	" Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins , then ? "
83572	83582	83569	83570	the duchess	547	" What becomes of your simile about the orchid ? "
83583	83625	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues , Gladys . You , as a good Tory , must not underrate them . Beer , the Bible , and the seven deadly virtues have made our England what she is . "
83626	83636	83637	83637	she	547	" You do n't like your country , then ? "
83640	83646	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" I live in it . "
83647	83656	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" That you may censure it the better . "
83657	83670	83671	83671	he	1688	" Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it ? "
83674	83682	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" What do they say of us ? "
83683	83695	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop . "
83696	83703	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Is that yours , Harry ? "
83704	83711	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" I give it to you . "
83712	83724	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" I could not use it . It is too true . "
83725	83739	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" You need not be afraid . Our countrymen never recognize a description . "
83740	83745	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" They are practical . "
83746	83772	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" They are more cunning than practical . When they make up their ledger , they balance stupidity by wealth , and vice by hypocrisy . "
83773	83782	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Still , we have done great things . "
83783	83794	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Great things have been thrust on us , Gladys . "
83795	83802	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" We have carried their burden . "
83803	83812	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Only as far as the Stock Exchange . "
83818	83825	83826	83826	she	1689	" I believe in the race , "
83829	83838	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" It represents the survival of the pushing . "
83839	83844	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" It has development . "
83845	83851	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Decay fascinates me more . "
83852	83857	83858	83858	she	1689	" What of art ? "
83861	83867	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" It is a malady . "
83868	83871	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Love ? "
83872	83876	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" An illusion . "
83877	83880	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Religion ? "
83881	83888	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" The fashionable substitute for belief . "
83889	83895	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" You are a sceptic . "
83896	83906	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Never ! Scepticism is the beginning of faith . "
83907	83912	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" What are you ? "
83913	83920	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" To define is to limit . "
83921	83927	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Give me a clue . "
83928	83941	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Threads snap . You would lose your way in the labyrinth . "
83942	83955	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" You bewilder me . Let us talk of some one else . "
83956	83972	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Our host is a delightful topic . Years ago he was christened Prince Charming . "
83973	83983	83985	83986	Dorian Gray	115	" Ah ! do n't remind me of that , "
83988	83997	83999	84000	the duchess	547	" Our host is rather horrid this evening , "
84004	84029	83999	84000	the duchess	547	" I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly . "
84030	84045	84047	84047	Dorian	115	" Well , I hope he wo n't stick pins into you , Duchess , "
84049	84068	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" Oh ! my maid does that already , Mr. Gray , when she is annoyed with me . "
84069	84082	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" And what does she get annoyed with you about , Duchess ? "
84083	84121	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" For the most trivial things , Mr. Gray , I assure you . Usually because I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by half - past eight . "
84122	84134	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" How unreasonable of her ! You should give her warning . "
84135	84199	83355	83356	Lord Henry	112	" I dare n't , Mr. Gray . Why , she invents hats for me . You remember the one I wore at Lady Hilstone 's garden - party ? You do n't , but it is nice of you to pretend that you do . Well , she made it out of nothing . All good hats are made out of nothing . "
84200	84208	84210	84211	Lord Henry	112	" Like all good reputations , Gladys , "
84213	84233	84210	84211	Lord Henry	112	" Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy . To be popular one must be a mediocrity . "
84234	84239	84241	84242	the duchess	547	" Not with women , "
84248	84293	84245	84245	her	547	" and women rule the world . I assure you we ca n't bear mediocrities . We women , as some one says , love with our ears , just as you men love with your eyes , if you ever love at all . "
84294	84306	84308	84308	Dorian	115	" It seems to me that we never do anything else , "
84310	84323	84325	84326	the duchess	547	" Ah ! then , you never really love , Mr. Gray , "
84331	84336	84338	84339	Lord Henry	112	" My dear Gladys ! "
84341	84420	84338	84339	Lord Henry	112	" How can you say that ? Romance lives by repetition , and repetition converts an appetite into an art . Besides , each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved . Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion . It merely intensifies it . We can have in life but one great experience at best , and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible . "
84421	84433	84435	84436	the duchess	547	" Even when one has been wounded by it , Harry ? "
84441	84451	84453	84454	Lord Henry	112	" Especially when one has been wounded by it , "
84472	84483	84484	84484	she	547	" What do you say to that , Mr. Gray ? "
84502	84511	84494	84494	he	115	" I always agree with Harry , Duchess . "
84512	84519	84456	84457	The duchess	547	" Even when he is wrong ? "
84520	84528	84494	84494	he	115	" Harry is never wrong , Duchess . "
84529	84538	84456	84457	The duchess	547	" And does his philosophy make you happy ? "
84539	84557	84494	84494	he	115	" I have never searched for happiness . Who wants happiness ? I have searched for pleasure . "
84558	84566	84456	84457	The duchess	547	" And found it , Mr. Gray ? "
84567	84573	84494	84494	he	115	" Often . Too often . "
84578	84585	84586	84586	she	547	" I am searching for peace , "
84589	84606	84586	84586	she	547	" and if I do n't go and dress , I shall have none this evening . "
84607	84617	84619	84619	Dorian	115	" Let me get you some orchids , Duchess , "
84631	84639	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" You are flirting disgracefully with him , "
84647	84659	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" You had better take care . He is very fascinating . "
84660	84672	84586	84586	she	547	" If he were not , there would be no battle . "
84673	84680	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" Greek meets Greek , then ? "
84681	84697	84586	84586	she	547	" I am on the side of the Trojans . They fought for a woman . "
84698	84703	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" They were defeated . "
84704	84712	84713	84713	she	1698	" There are worse things than capture , "
84716	84724	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" You gallop with a loose rein . "
84725	84730	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" Pace gives life , "
84737	84749	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" I shall write it in my diary to - night . "
84750	84753	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" What ? "
84754	84763	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" That a burnt child loves the fire . "
84764	84776	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" I am not even singed . My wings are untouched . "
84777	84787	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" You use them for everything , except flight . "
84788	84805	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" Courage has passed from men to women . It is a new experience for us . "
84806	84812	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" You have a rival . "
84813	84816	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" Who ? "
84820	84824	84825	84825	he	1699	" Lady Narborough , "
84828	84834	84825	84825	he	1699	" She perfectly adores him . "
84835	84854	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" You fill me with apprehension . The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us who are romanticists . "
84855	84866	84825	84825	he	1699	" Romanticists ! You have all the methods of science . "
84867	84873	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" Men have educated us . "
84874	84880	84825	84825	he	1699	" But not explained you . "
84881	84888	84641	84642	Lord Henry	112	" Describe us as a sex , "
84893	84898	84825	84825	he	1699	" Sphinxes without secrets . "
84906	84913	84914	84914	she	1700	" How long Mr. Gray is ! "
84917	84937	84899	84899	She	1700	" Let us go and help him . I have not yet told him the colour of my frock . "
84938	84952	84825	84825	he	1699	" Ah ! you must suit your frock to his flowers , Gladys . "
84953	84961	84899	84899	She	1700	" That would be a premature surrender . "
84962	84970	84825	84825	he	1699	" Romantic art begins with its climax . "
84971	84980	84899	84899	She	1700	" I must keep an opportunity for retreat . "
84981	84987	84825	84825	he	1699	" In the Parthian manner ? "
84988	85002	84899	84899	She	1700	" They found safety in the desert . I could not do that . "
85003	85012	85013	85013	he	1699	" Women are not always allowed a choice , "
85123	85128	85129	85129	he	115	" What has happened ? "
85132	85145	85129	85129	he	115	" Oh ! I remember . Am I safe here , Harry ? "
85151	85156	85158	85159	Lord Henry	112	" My dear Dorian , "
85161	85191	85158	85159	Lord Henry	112	" you merely fainted . That was all . You must have overtired yourself . You had better not come down to dinner . I will take your place . "
85192	85200	85201	85201	he	115	" No , I will come down , "
85209	85222	85201	85201	he	115	" I would rather come down . I must not be alone . "
86122	86131	86132	86132	he	1982	" Have you had good sport , Geoffrey ? "
86135	86171	86109	86109	his	1982	" Not very good , Dorian . I think most of the birds have gone to the open . I dare say it will be better after lunch , when we get to new ground . "
86321	86333	86315	86315	he	330	" Do n't shoot it , Geoffrey . Let it live . "
86334	86340	86354	86354	he	330	" What nonsense , Dorian ! "
86387	86397	86399	86400	Sir Geoffrey	330	" Good heavens ! I have hit a beater ! "
86402	86421	86422	86422	he	330	" What an ass the man was to get in front of the guns ! Stop shooting there ! "
86432	86438	86422	86422	he	330	" A man is hurt . "
86453	86462	86463	86463	he	1743	" Where , sir ? Where is he ? "
86478	86481	86483	86484	Sir Geoffrey	330	" Here , "
86492	86511	86483	86484	Sir Geoffrey	330	" Why on earth do n't you keep your men back ? Spoiled my shooting for the day . "
86660	86663	86665	86666	Lord Henry	112	" Dorian , "
86668	86693	86665	86666	Lord Henry	112	" I had better tell them that the shooting is stopped for to - day . It would not look well to go on . "
86694	86705	86706	86706	he	115	" I wish it were stopped for ever , Harry , "
86710	86724	86706	86706	he	115	" The whole thing is hideous and cruel . Is the man ... ? "
86732	86738	86740	86741	Lord Henry	112	" I am afraid so , "
86743	86769	86740	86741	Lord Henry	112	" He got the whole charge of shot in his chest . He must have died almost instantaneously . Come ; let us go home . "
86802	86816	86789	86789	Dorian	115	" It is a bad omen , Harry , a very bad omen . "
86817	86821	86823	86824	Lord Henry	112	" What is ? "
86826	86920	86823	86824	Lord Henry	112	" Oh ! this accident , I suppose . My dear fellow , it ca n't be helped . It was the man 's own fault . Why did he get in front of the guns ? Besides , it is nothing to us . It is rather awkward for Geoffrey , of course . It does not do to pepper beaters . It makes people think that one is a wild shot . And Geoffrey is not ; he shoots very straight . But there is no use talking about the matter . "
86926	86955	86956	86956	he	115	" It is a bad omen , Harry . I feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us . To myself , perhaps , "
86977	87105	86972	86974	The elder man	939	" The only horrible thing in the world is _ ennui _ , Dorian . That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness . But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner . I must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed . As for omens , there is no such thing as an omen . Destiny does not send us heralds . She is too wise or too cruel for that . Besides , what on earth could happen to you , Dorian ? You have everything in the world that a man can want . There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you . "
87106	87200	86972	86974	The elder man	939	" There is no one with whom I would not change places , Harry . Do n't laugh like that . I am telling you the truth . The wretched peasant who has just died is better off than I am . I have no terror of death . It is the coming of death that terrifies me . Its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me . Good heavens ! do n't you see a man moving behind the trees there , watching me , waiting for me ? "
87216	87219	87220	87220	he	112	" Yes , "
87225	87279	87220	87220	he	112	" I see the gardener waiting for you . I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table to - night . How absurdly nervous you are , my dear fellow ! You must come and see my doctor , when we get back to town . "
87324	87335	87336	87336	he	1982	" Her Grace told me to wait for an answer , "
87347	87357	87358	87358	he	1982	" Tell her Grace that I am coming in , "
87377	87387	87389	87390	Lord Henry	112	" How fond women are of doing dangerous things ! "
87392	87424	87389	87390	Lord Henry	112	" It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most . A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on . "
87425	87461	87339	87339	Dorian	115	" How fond you are of saying dangerous things , Harry ! In the present instance , you are quite astray . I like the duchess very much , but I do n't love her . "
87462	87483	87389	87390	Lord Henry	112	" And the duchess loves you very much , but she likes you less , so you are excellently matched . "
87484	87501	87339	87339	Dorian	115	" You are talking scandal , Harry , and there is never any basis for scandal . "
87502	87513	87515	87516	Lord Henry	112	" The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty , "
87522	87537	87339	87339	Dorian	115	" You would sacrifice anybody , Harry , for the sake of an epigram . "
87538	87550	87339	87339	Dorian	115	" The world goes to the altar of its own accord , "
87555	87562	87564	87565	Dorian Gray	115	" I wish I could love , "
87576	87655	87573	87573	his	115	" But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire . I am too much concentrated on myself . My own personality has become a burden to me . I want to escape , to go away , to forget . It was silly of me to come down here at all . I think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready . On a yacht one is safe . "
87656	87684	87339	87339	Dorian	115	" Safe from what , Dorian ? You are in some trouble . Why not tell me what it is ? You know I would help you . "
87685	87694	87695	87695	he	1756	" I ca n't tell you , Harry , "
87699	87734	87695	87695	he	1756	" And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine . This unfortunate accident has upset me . I have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me . "
87735	87739	87339	87339	Dorian	115	" What nonsense ! "
87740	87780	87695	87695	he	1756	" I hope it is , but I ca n't help feeling it . Ah ! here is the duchess , looking like Artemis in a tailor - made gown . You see we have come back , Duchess . "
87781	87792	87793	87793	she	1756	" I have heard all about it , Mr. Gray , "
87796	87819	87793	87793	she	1756	" Poor Geoffrey is terribly upset . And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare . How curious ! "
87820	87870	87695	87695	he	1756	" Yes , it was very curious . I do n't know what made me say it . Some whim , I suppose . It looked the loveliest of little live things . But I am sorry they told you about the man . It is a hideous subject . "
87871	87878	87881	87882	Lord Henry	112	" It is an annoying subject , "
87884	87923	87881	87882	Lord Henry	112	" It has no psychological value at all . Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on purpose , how interesting he would be ! I should like to know some one who had committed a real murder . "
87924	87932	87934	87935	the duchess	547	" How horrid of you , Harry ! "
87937	87959	87934	87935	the duchess	547	" Is n't it , Mr. Gray ? Harry , Mr. Gray is ill again . He is going to faint . "
87970	87977	87978	87978	he	115	" It is nothing , Duchess , "
87981	88043	87978	87978	he	115	" my nerves are dreadfully out of order . That is all . I am afraid I walked too far this morning . I did n't hear what Harry said . Was it very bad ? You must tell me some other time . I think I must go and lie down . You will excuse me , wo n't you ? "
88083	88093	88094	88094	he	112	" Are you very much in love with him ? "
88112	88118	88119	88119	she	547	" I wish I knew , "
88129	88149	88124	88124	He	112	" Knowledge would be fatal . It is the uncertainty that charms one . A mist makes things wonderful . "
88150	88158	88097	88097	She	547	" One may lose one 's way . "
88159	88172	88124	88124	He	112	" All ways end at the same point , my dear Gladys . "
88173	88178	88097	88097	She	547	" What is that ? "
88179	88182	88124	88124	He	112	" Disillusion . "
88183	88193	88194	88194	she	547	" It was my _ debut _ in life , "
88197	88204	88124	88124	He	112	" It came to you crowned . "
88205	88213	88124	88124	He	112	" I am tired of strawberry leaves . "
88214	88219	88124	88124	He	112	" They become you . "
88220	88225	88124	88124	He	112	" Only in public . "
88226	88232	88234	88235	Lord Henry	112	" You would miss them , "
88237	88246	88124	88124	He	112	" I will not part with a petal . "
88247	88252	88124	88124	He	112	" Monmouth has ears . "
88253	88261	88124	88124	He	112	" Old age is dull of hearing . "
88262	88269	88124	88124	He	112	" Has he never been jealous ? "
88270	88277	88124	88124	He	112	" I wish he had been . "
88288	88295	88296	88296	she	547	" What are you looking for ? "
88299	88306	88307	88307	he	112	" The button from your foil , "
88310	88316	88307	88307	he	112	" You have dropped it . "
88320	88327	88317	88317	She	547	" I have still the mask . "
88328	88335	88337	88337	his	112	" It makes your eyes lovelier , "
88589	88594	88595	88595	he	112	" Send him in , "
88626	88642	88643	88643	he	115	" I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning , Thornton ? "
88651	88656	88658	88659	the gamekeeper	1775	" Yes , sir , "
88661	88676	88678	88678	Dorian	115	" Was the poor fellow married ? Had he any people dependent on him ? "
88683	88711	88678	88678	Dorian	115	" If so , I should not like them to be left in want , and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary . "
88712	88736	88788	88789	Dorian Gray	115	" We do n't know who he is , sir . That is what I took the liberty of coming to you about . "
88737	88745	88747	88747	Dorian	115	" Do n't know who he is ? "
88751	88765	88747	88747	Dorian	115	" What do you mean ? Was n't he one of your men ? "
88766	88783	88788	88789	Dorian Gray	115	" No , sir . Never saw him before . Seems like a sailor , sir . "
88805	88809	88810	88810	he	115	" A sailor ? "
88814	88821	88810	88810	he	115	" Did you say a sailor ? "
88822	88850	88747	88747	Dorian	115	" Yes , sir . He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor ; tattooed on both arms , and that kind of thing . "
88851	88859	88861	88861	Dorian	115	" Was there anything found on him ? "
88874	88882	88861	88861	Dorian	115	" Anything that would tell his name ? "
88883	88926	88747	88747	Dorian	115	" Some money , sir - not much , and a six - shooter . There was no name of any kind . A decent - looking man , sir , but rough - like . A sort of sailor we think . "
88946	88952	88953	88953	he	115	" Where is the body ? "
88956	88966	88953	88953	he	115	" Quick ! I must see it at once . "
88967	89004	88927	88927	Dorian	115	" It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm , sir . The folk do n't like to have that sort of thing in their houses . They say a corpse brings bad luck . "
89005	89047	88953	88953	he	115	" The Home Farm ! Go there at once and meet me . Tell one of the grooms to bring my horse round . No . Never mind . I 'll go to the stables myself . It will save time . "
89319	89333	89334	89334	he	115	" Take that thing off the face . I wish to see it , "
89412	89428	89430	89431	Lord Henry	112	" There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good , "
89448	89460	89434	89434	his	112	" You are quite perfect . Pray , do n't change . "
89467	89499	89464	89464	his	115	" No , Harry , I have done too many dreadful things in my life . I am not going to do any more . I began my good actions yesterday . "
89500	89506	89461	89462	Dorian Gray	115	" Where were you yesterday ? "
89507	89524	89464	89464	his	115	" In the country , Harry . I was staying at a little inn by myself . "
89525	89530	89532	89533	Lord Henry	112	" My dear boy , "
89537	89618	89532	89533	Lord Henry	112	" anybody can be good in the country . There are no temptations there . That is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized . Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to . There are only two ways by which man can reach it . One is by being cultured , the other by being corrupt . Country people have no opportunity of being either , so they stagnate . "
89619	89624	89626	89626	Dorian	115	" Culture and corruption , "
89628	89671	89626	89626	Dorian	115	" I have known something of both . It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together . For I have a new ideal , Harry . I am going to alter . I think I have altered . "
89672	89696	89701	89701	he	115	" You have not yet told me what your good action was . Or did you say you had done more than one ? "
89730	89917	89701	89701	he	115	" I can tell you , Harry . It is not a story I could tell to any one else . I spared somebody . It sounds vain , but you understand what I mean . She was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane . I think it was that which first attracted me to her . You remember Sibyl , do n't you ? How long ago that seems ! Well , Hetty was not one of our own class , of course . She was simply a girl in a village . But I really loved her . I am quite sure that I loved her . All during this wonderful May that we have been having , I used to run down and see her two or three times a week . Yesterday she met me in a little orchard . The apple - blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair , and she was laughing . We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn . Suddenly I determined to leave her as flowerlike as I had found her . "
89918	89939	89941	89942	Lord Henry	112	" I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real pleasure , Dorian , "
89944	89972	89941	89942	Lord Henry	112	" But I can finish your idyll for you . You gave her good advice and broke her heart . That was the beginning of your reformation . "
89973	90027	89701	89701	he	115	" Harry , you are horrible ! You must n't say these dreadful things . Hetty 's heart is not broken . Of course , she cried and all that . But there is no disgrace upon her . She can live , like Perdita , in her garden of mint and marigold . "
90028	90036	90038	90039	Lord Henry	112	" And weep over a faithless Florizel , "
90051	90189	90044	90044	he	112	" My dear Dorian , you have the most curiously boyish moods . Do you think this girl will ever be really content now with any one of her own rank ? I suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman . Well , the fact of having met you , and loved you , will teach her to despise her husband , and she will be wretched . From a moral point of view , I can not say that I think much of your great renunciation . Even as a beginning , it is poor . Besides , how do you know that Hetty is n't floating at the present moment in some starlit mill - pond , with lovely water - lilies round her , like Ophelia ? "
90190	90352	89701	89701	he	115	" I ca n't bear this , Harry ! You mock at everything , and then suggest the most serious tragedies . I am sorry I told you now . I do n't care what you say to me . I know I was right in acting as I did . Poor Hetty ! As I rode past the farm this morning , I saw her white face at the window , like a spray of jasmine . Do n't let us talk about it any more , and do n't try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years , the first little bit of self - sacrifice I have ever known , is really a sort of sin . I want to be better . I am going to be better . Tell me something about yourself . What is going on in town ? I have not been to the club for days . "
90353	90364	90044	90044	he	112	" The people are still discussing poor Basil 's disappearance . "
90365	90380	90382	90382	Dorian	115	" I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time , "
90393	90563	90044	90044	he	112	" My dear boy , they have only been talking about it for six weeks , and the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months . They have been very fortunate lately , however . They have had my own divorce - case and Alan Campbell 's suicide . Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist . Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor Basil , and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris at all . I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has been seen in San Francisco . It is an odd thing , but every one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco . It must be a delightful city , and possess all the attractions of the next world . "
90564	90574	90576	90576	Dorian	115	" What do you think has happened to Basil ? "
90599	90649	90044	90044	he	112	" I have not the slightest idea . If Basil chooses to hide himself , it is no business of mine . If he is dead , I do n't want to think about him . Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me . I hate it . "
90650	90653	90655	90657	the younger man	1360	" Why ? "
90660	90663	90665	90666	Lord Henry	112	" Because , "
90681	90804	90665	90666	Lord Henry	112	" one can survive everything nowadays except that . Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one can not explain away . Let us have our coffee in the music - room , Dorian . You must play Chopin to me . The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely . Poor Victoria ! I was very fond of her . The house is rather lonely without her . Of course , married life is merely a habit , a bad habit . But then one regrets the loss even of one 's worst habits . Perhaps one regrets them the most . They are such an essential part of one 's personality . "
90862	90876	90857	90858	Lord Henry	112	" Harry , did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered ? "
90881	90978	90877	90878	Lord Henry	112	" Basil was very popular , and always wore a Waterbury watch . Why should he have been murdered ? He was not clever enough to have enemies . Of course , he had a wonderful genius for painting . But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible . Basil was really rather dull . He only interested me once , and that was when he told me , years ago , that he had a wild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art . "
90979	90987	90989	90989	Dorian	115	" I was very fond of Basil , "
90999	91010	90996	90996	his	115	" But do n't people say that he was murdered ? "
91011	91066	90877	90878	Lord Henry	112	" Oh , some of the papers do . It does not seem to me to be at all probable . I know there are dreadful places in Paris , but Basil was not the sort of man to have gone to them . He had no curiosity . It was his chief defect . "
91067	91085	91087	91089	the younger man	1360	" What would you say , Harry , if I told you that I had murdered Basil ? "
91100	91207	91091	91091	He	1360	" I would say , my dear fellow , that you were posing for a character that does n't suit you . All crime is vulgar , just as all vulgarity is crime . It is not in you , Dorian , to commit a murder . I am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so , but I assure you it is true . Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders . I do n't blame them in the smallest degree . I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us , simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations . "
91208	91244	90877	90878	Lord Henry	112	" A method of procuring sensations ? Do you think , then , that a man who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again ? Do n't tell me that . "
91245	91259	91261	91262	Lord Henry	112	" Oh ! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often , "
91266	91427	91261	91262	Lord Henry	112	" That is one of the most important secrets of life . I should fancy , however , that murder is always a mistake . One should never do anything that one can not talk about after dinner . But let us pass from poor Basil . I wish I could believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as you suggest , but I ca n't . I dare say he fell into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal . Yes : I should fancy that was his end . I see him lying now on his back under those dull - green waters , with the heavy barges floating over him and long weeds catching in his hair . Do you know , I do n't think he would have done much more good work . During the last ten years his painting had gone off very much . "
91502	91505	91506	91506	he	112	" Yes , "
91520	91723	91506	91506	he	112	" his painting had quite gone off . It seemed to me to have lost something . It had lost an ideal . When you and he ceased to be great friends , he ceased to be a great artist . What was it separated you ? I suppose he bored you . If so , he never forgave you . It 's a habit bores have . By the way , what has become of that wonderful portrait he did of you ? I do n't think I have ever seen it since he finished it . Oh ! I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to Selby , and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way . You never got it back ? What a pity ! it was really a masterpiece . I remember I wanted to buy it . I wish I had now . It belonged to Basil 's best period . Since then , his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative British artist . Did you advertise for it ? You should . "
91724	91728	91730	91730	Dorian	115	" I forget , "
91732	91791	91730	91730	Dorian	115	" I suppose I did . But I never really liked it . I am sorry I sat for it . The memory of the thing is hateful to me . Why do you talk of it ? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some play - Hamlet , I think - how do they run?-
91792	91806	91506	91506	he	112	" Like the painting of a sorrow , A face without a heart . "
91816	91816	91730	91730	Dorian	115	"
91821	91835	91836	91836	he	112	" If a man treats life artistically , his brain is his heart , "
91860	91870	91871	91871	he	115	" ' Like the painting of a sorrow , ' "
91874	91883	91871	91871	he	115	" ' a face without a heart . ' "
91899	91906	91907	91907	he	115	" By the way , Dorian , "
91913	91939	91907	91907	he	115	" ' what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose - how does the quotation run?-his own soul ' ? "
91954	91964	91945	91946	Dorian Gray	115	" Why do you ask me that , Harry ? "
91965	91970	91972	91973	Lord Henry	112	" My dear fellow , "
91981	92153	91972	91973	Lord Henry	112	" I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer . That is all . I was going through the park last Sunday , and close by the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby - looking people listening to some vulgar street - preacher . As I passed by , I heard the man yelling out that question to his audience . It struck me as being rather dramatic . London is very rich in curious effects of that kind . A wet Sunday , an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh , a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas , and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips - it was really very good in its way , quite a suggestion . I thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul , but that man had not . I am afraid , however , he would not have understood me . "
92154	92202	91945	91946	Dorian Gray	115	" Do n't , Harry . The soul is a terrible reality . It can be bought , and sold , and bartered away . It can be poisoned , or made perfect . There is a soul in each one of us . I know it . "
92203	92214	91972	91973	Lord Henry	112	" Do you feel quite sure of that , Dorian ? "
92215	92219	91945	91946	Dorian Gray	115	" Quite sure . "
92220	92746	91972	91973	Lord Henry	112	" Ah ! then it must be an illusion . The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true . That is the fatality of faith , and the lesson of romance . How grave you are ! Do n't be so serious . What have you or I to do with the superstitions of our age ? No : we have given up our belief in the soul . Play me something . Play me a nocturne , Dorian , and , as you play , tell me , in a low voice , how you have kept your youth . You must have some secret . I am only ten years older than you are , and I am wrinkled , and worn , and yellow . You are really wonderful , Dorian . You have never looked more charming than you do to - night . You remind me of the day I saw you first . You were rather cheeky , very shy , and absolutely extraordinary . You have changed , of course , but not in appearance . I wish you would tell me your secret . To get back my youth I would do anything in the world , except take exercise , get up early , or be respectable . Youth ! There is nothing like it . It 's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth . The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself . They seem in front of me . Life has revealed to them her latest wonder . As for the aged , I always contradict the aged . I do it on principle . If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday , they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820 , when people wore high stocks , believed in everything , and knew absolutely nothing . How lovely that thing you are playing is ! I wonder , did Chopin write it at Majorca , with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes ? It is marvellously romantic . What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is not imitative ! Do n't stop . I want music to - night . It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you . I have sorrows , Dorian , of my own , that even you know nothing of . The tragedy of old age is not that one is old , but that one is young . I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity . Ah , Dorian , how happy you are ! What an exquisite life you have had ! You have drunk deeply of everything . You have crushed the grapes against your palate . Nothing has been hidden from you . And it has all been to you no more than the sound of music . It has not marred you . You are still the same . "
92747	92756	91945	91946	Dorian Gray	115	" I am not the same , Harry . "
92757	93092	91972	91973	Lord Henry	112	" Yes , you are the same . I wonder what the rest of your life will be . Do n't spoil it by renunciations . At present you are a perfect type . Do n't make yourself incomplete . You are quite flawless now . You need not shake your head : you know you are . Besides , Dorian , do n't deceive yourself . Life is not governed by will or intention . Life is a question of nerves , and fibres , and slowly built - up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams . You may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong . But a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky , a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it , a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again , a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play - I tell you , Dorian , that it is on things like these that our lives depend . Browning writes about that somewhere ; but our own senses will imagine them for us . There are moments when the odour of _ lilas blanc _ passes suddenly across me , and I have to live the strangest month of my life over again . I wish I could change places with you , Dorian . The world has cried out against us both , but it has always worshipped you . It always will worship you . You are the type of what the age is searching for , and what it is afraid it has found . I am so glad that you have never done anything , never carved a statue , or painted a picture , or produced anything outside of yourself ! Life has been your art . You have set yourself to music . Your days are your sonnets . "
93107	93115	93116	93116	he	115	" Yes , life has been exquisite , "
93119	93173	93116	93116	he	115	" but I am not going to have the same life , Harry . And you must not say these extravagant things to me . You do n't know everything about me . I think that if you did , even you would turn from me . You laugh . Do n't laugh . "
93174	93308	91972	91973	Lord Henry	112	" Why have you stopped playing , Dorian ? Go back and give me the nocturne over again . Look at that great , honey - coloured moon that hangs in the dusky air . She is waiting for you to charm her , and if you play she will come closer to the earth . You wo n't ? Let us go to the club , then . It has been a charming evening , and we must end it charmingly . There is some one at White 's who wants immensely to know you - young Lord Poole , Bournemouth 's eldest son . He has already copied your neckties , and has begged me to introduce him to you . He is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you . "
93309	93314	93316	93316	Dorian	115	" I hope not , "
93325	93358	93316	93316	Dorian	115	" But I am tired to - night , Harry . I sha n't go to the club . It is nearly eleven , and I want to go to bed early . "
93359	93397	91972	91973	Lord Henry	112	" Do stay . You have never played so well as to - night . There was something in your touch that was wonderful . It had more expression than I had ever heard from it before . "
93398	93409	93410	93410	he	115	" It is because I am going to be good , "
93415	93423	93410	93410	he	115	" I am a little changed already . "
93424	93434	93436	93437	Lord Henry	112	" You can not change to me , Dorian , "
93439	93448	93436	93437	Lord Henry	112	" You and I will always be friends . "
93449	93484	91972	91973	Lord Henry	112	" Yet you poisoned me with a book once . I should not forgive that . Harry , promise me that you will never lend that book to any one . It does harm . "
93485	93724	93436	93437	Lord Henry	112	" My dear boy , you are really beginning to moralize . You will soon be going about like the converted , and the revivalist , warning people against all the sins of which you have grown tired . You are much too delightful to do that . Besides , it is no use . You and I are what we are , and will be what we will be . As for being poisoned by a book , there is no such thing as that . Art has no influence upon action . It annihilates the desire to act . It is superbly sterile . The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame . That is all . But we wo n't discuss literature . Come round to - morrow . I am going to ride at eleven . We might go together , and I will take you to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome . She is a charming woman , and wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying . Mind you come . Or shall we lunch with our little duchess ? She says she never sees you now . Perhaps you are tired of Gladys ? I thought you would be . Her clever tongue gets on one 's nerves . Well , in any case , be here at eleven . "
93725	93733	91972	91973	Lord Henry	112	" Must I really come , Harry ? "
93734	93760	93436	93437	Lord Henry	112	" Certainly . The park is quite lovely now . I do n't think there have been such lilacs since the year I met you . "
93761	93772	93774	93774	Dorian	115	" Very well . I shall be here at eleven , "
93776	93782	93774	93774	Dorian	115	" Good night , Harry . "
93867	93873	93861	93861	them	1799	" That is Dorian Gray . "
94257	94262	94278	94281	a most just God	1812	" Forgive us our sins "
94264	94270	94278	94281	a most just God	1812	" Smite us for our iniquities "
94383	94405	94362	94368	some one who had terribly loved him	1813	" The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold . The curves of your lips rewrite history . "
95796	95804	95806	95811	the elder of the two gentlemen	1838	" Whose house is that , Constable ? "
95813	95821	95823	95824	the policeman	1393	" Mr. Dorian Gray 's , sir , "
