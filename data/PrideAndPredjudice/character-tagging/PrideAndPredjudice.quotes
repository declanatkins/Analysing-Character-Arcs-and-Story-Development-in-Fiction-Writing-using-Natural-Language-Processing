77	83	85	86	his lady	230	" My dear Mr. Bennet , "
92	104	85	86	his lady	230	" have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? "
113	118	120	120	she	230	" But it is , "
122	139	120	120	she	230	" for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . "
146	158	160	161	his wife	231	" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? "
165	183	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" _ You _ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . "
189	277	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . "
278	284	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" What is his name ? "
285	288	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" Bingley . "
289	296	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" Is he married or single ? "
297	331	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" Oh , single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . What a fine thing for our girls ! "
332	342	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" How so ? how can it affect them ? "
343	349	351	352	his wife	231	" My dear Mr. Bennet , "
354	376	351	352	his wife	231	" how can you be so tiresome ? You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . "
377	386	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" Is that his design in settling here ? "
387	428	351	352	his wife	231	" Design ? Nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . "
429	481	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" I see no occasion for that . You and the girls may go -- or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better ; for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party . "
482	533	351	352	his wife	231	" My dear , you flatter me . I certainly _ have _ had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now . When a woman has five grown - up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . "
534	550	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . "
551	572	351	352	his wife	231	" But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . "
573	586	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" It is more than I engage for , I assure you . "
587	657	351	352	his wife	231	" But consider your daughters . Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account ; for in general , you know , they visit no new comers . Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him , if you do not . "
658	718	140	141	Mr. Bennet	75	" You are over scrupulous , surely . I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls -- though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . "
719	772	351	352	his wife	231	" I desire you will do no such thing . Lizzy is not a bit better than the others : and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good - humoured as Lydia . But you are always giving _ her _ the preference . "
773	784	786	786	he	234	" They have none of them much to recommend them , "
788	810	786	786	he	234	" they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . "
811	843	351	352	his wife	231	" Mr. Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? You take delight in vexing me . You have no compassion on my poor nerves . "
844	881	786	786	he	234	" You mistake me , my dear . I have a high respect for your nerves . They are my old friends . I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . "
882	893	351	352	his wife	231	" Ah , you do not know what I suffer . "
894	921	786	786	he	234	" But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . "
922	944	351	352	his wife	231	" It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . "
945	965	786	786	he	234	" Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . "
1136	1147	1131	1131	he	75	" I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . "
1148	1164	1166	1167	her mother	241	" We are not in a way to know _ what _ Mr. Bingley likes , "
1171	1179	1166	1167	her mother	241	" since we are not to visit . "
1180	1187	1189	1189	Elizabeth	82	" But you forget , mamma , "
1191	1211	1189	1189	Elizabeth	82	" that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . "
1212	1249	1279	1280	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . "
1250	1256	1258	1259	Mr. Bennet	75	" No more have I , "
1261	1278	1258	1259	Mr. Bennet	75	" and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "
1302	1330	1279	1280	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Do n't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven 's sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . "
1331	1340	1342	1343	her father	244	" Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , "
1345	1351	1342	1343	her father	244	" she times them ill . "
1352	1362	1364	1364	Kitty	86	" I do not cough for my own amusement , "
1368	1379	1364	1364	Kitty	86	" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? "
1380	1386	1279	1280	Mrs. Bennet	85	" To - morrow fortnight . "
1387	1394	1396	1397	her mother	241	" Ay , so it is , "
1399	1432	1396	1397	her mother	241	" and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . "
1433	1457	1279	1280	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . "
1458	1482	1396	1397	her mother	241	" Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? "
1483	1568	1279	1280	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I honour your circumspection . A fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if _ we _ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . "
1581	1586	1576	1577	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Nonsense , nonsense ! "
1587	1598	1600	1600	he	247	" What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "
1602	1662	1600	1600	he	247	" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? I can not quite agree with you _ there _ . What say you , Mary ? For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books , and make extracts . "
1676	1684	1685	1685	he	247	" While Mary is adjusting her ideas , "
1688	1696	1685	1685	he	247	" let us return to Mr. Bingley . "
1697	1705	1707	1708	his wife	231	" I am sick of Mr. Bingley , "
1710	1770	1707	1708	his wife	231	" I am sorry to hear _ that _ ; but why did you not tell me so before ? If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . "
1816	1889	1801	1801	she	231	" How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! And it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . "
1890	1904	1906	1907	Mr. Bennet	75	" Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , "
1928	1938	1940	1940	she	231	" What an excellent father you have , girls , "
1948	2033	1940	1940	she	231	" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . At our time of life , it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes we would do anything . Lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . "
2034	2037	2039	2039	Lydia	84	" Oh , "
2043	2063	2039	2039	Lydia	84	" I am not afraid ; for though I _ am _ the youngest , I 'm the tallest . "
2253	2268	2270	2271	Mrs. Bennet	85	" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , "
2276	2293	2270	2271	Mrs. Bennet	85	" and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . "
3044	3049	3051	3051	he	89	" Come , Darcy , "
3053	3080	3051	3051	he	89	" I must have you dance . I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . You had much better dance . "
3081	3143	3024	3025	Mr. Bingley	79	" I certainly shall not . You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . "
3144	3155	3157	3157	Bingley	79	" I would not be so fastidious as you are , "
3159	3198	3157	3157	Bingley	79	" for a kingdom ! Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them , you see , uncommonly pretty . "
3199	3214	3216	3217	Mr. Darcy	89	" _ You _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , "
3226	3274	3286	3286	he	89	" Oh , she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very agreeable . Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "
3275	3281	3286	3286	he	89	" Which do you mean ? "
3309	3366	3300	3300	he	89	" She is tolerable : but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . "
3631	3639	3641	3641	she	231	" Oh , my dear Mr. Bennet , "
3646	3845	3641	3641	she	231	" we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . I wish you had been there . Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . Only think of _ that _ , my dear : he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the _ Boulanger_---- "
3846	3858	3860	3861	her husband	255	" If he had had any compassion for _ me _ , "
3864	3898	3860	3861	her husband	255	" he would not have danced half so much ! For God 's sake , say no more of his partners . O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! "
3899	3905	3907	3908	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Oh , my dear , "
3910	3954	3907	3908	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I am quite delighted with him . He is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women . I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst 's gown---- "
4002	4009	4010	4010	she	85	" But I can assure you , "
4013	4106	4010	4010	she	85	" that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . So high and so conceited , that there was no enduring him ! He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! Not handsome enough to dance with ! I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs . I quite detest the man . "
4140	4153	4155	4155	she	327	" He is just what a young - man ought to be , "
4157	4184	4155	4155	she	327	" sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! "
4185	4191	4193	4193	Elizabeth	82	" He is also handsome , "
4195	4215	4193	4193	Elizabeth	82	" which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can . His character is thereby complete . "
4216	4240	4155	4155	she	327	" I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . I did not expect such a compliment . "
4241	4342	4193	4193	Elizabeth	82	" Did not you ? _ I _ did for you . But that is one great difference between us . Compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . What could be more natural than his asking you again ? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . No thanks to his gallantry for that . Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . You have liked many a stupider person . "
4343	4347	4155	4155	she	327	" Dear Lizzy ! "
4348	4401	4193	4193	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . You never see a fault in anybody . All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . "
4402	4422	4155	4155	she	327	" I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but I always speak what I think . "
4423	4527	4193	4193	Elizabeth	82	" I know you do : and it is _ that _ which makes the wonder . With _ your _ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! Affectation of candour is common enough ; one meets with it everywhere . But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the good of everybody 's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad,--belongs to you alone . And so , you like this man 's sisters , too , do you ? Their manners are not equal to his . "
4528	4578	4155	4155	she	327	" Certainly not , at first ; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . "
5631	5642	5644	5645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" _ You _ began the evening well , Charlotte , "
5657	5668	5644	5645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" _ You _ were Mr. Bingley 's first choice . "
5669	5681	5644	5645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . "
5682	5737	5644	5645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Oh , you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice . To be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her -- indeed , I rather believe he _ did_--I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson . "
5738	5829	5644	5645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson : did not I mention it to you ? Mr. Robinson 's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question , ' Oh , the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt : there can not be two opinions on that point . ' "
5830	5864	5644	5645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Upon my word ! Well , that was very decided , indeed -- that does seem as if -- but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . "
5865	5882	5884	5884	Charlotte	101	" _ My _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , Eliza , "
5886	5914	5884	5884	Charlotte	101	" Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? Poor Eliza ! to be only just _ tolerable _ . "
5915	5978	5644	5645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I beg you will not put it into Lizzy 's head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . "
5979	5994	5996	5996	Jane	83	" Are you quite sure , ma'am ? Is not there a little mistake ? "
5998	6008	5996	5996	Jane	83	" I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . "
6009	6043	5644	5645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Ay , because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . "
6044	6050	6052	6052	Jane	83	" Miss Bingley told me , "
6054	6075	6052	6052	Jane	83	" that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . With _ them _ he is remarkably agreeable . "
6076	6152	5644	5645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I do not believe a word of it , my dear . If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long . But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise . "
6153	6165	6167	6168	Miss Lucas	92	" I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , "
6170	6180	6167	6168	Miss Lucas	92	" but I wish he had danced with Eliza . "
6181	6187	6189	6190	her mother	241	" Another time , Lizzy , "
6192	6207	6189	6190	her mother	241	" I would not dance with _ him _ , if I were you . "
6208	6227	5644	5645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I believe , ma'am , I may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with him . "
6228	6232	6234	6235	Miss Lucas	92	" His pride , "
6237	6304	6234	6235	Miss Lucas	92	" does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . One can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . If I may so express it , he has a _ right _ to be proud . "
6305	6311	6313	6313	Elizabeth	103	" That is very true , "
6315	6335	6313	6313	Elizabeth	103	" and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . "
6336	6339	6341	6341	Mary	87	" Pride , "
6353	6465	6341	6341	Mary	87	" is a very common failing , I believe . By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . A person may be proud without being vain . Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves ; vanity to what we would have others think of us . "
6466	6476	6478	6480	a young Lucas	390	" If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy , "
6488	6515	6478	6480	a young Lucas	390	" I should not care how proud I was . I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . "
6516	6529	6531	6532	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , "
6534	6553	6531	6532	Mrs. Bennet	85	" and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly . "
6834	6843	6845	6845	Charlotte	101	" It may , perhaps , be pleasant , "
6847	7017	6845	6845	Charlotte	101	" to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . We can all _ begin _ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better show _ more _ affection than she feels . Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . "
7018	7057	6824	6824	She	83	" But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . If _ I _ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . "
7058	7075	6845	6845	Charlotte	101	" Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane 's disposition as you do . "
7076	7101	6824	6824	She	83	" But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavor to conceal it , he must find it out . "
7102	7195	6845	6845	Charlotte	101	" Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . "
7196	7204	7206	7206	Elizabeth	82	" Your plan is a good one , "
7208	7331	7206	7206	Elizabeth	82	" where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . But these are not Jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design . As yet she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . She has known him only a fortnight . She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . "
7332	7382	6845	6845	Charlotte	101	" Not as you represent it . Had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal . "
7383	7424	7206	7206	Elizabeth	82	" Yes : these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce , but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . "
7425	7428	7430	7430	Charlotte	101	" Well , "
7432	7558	7430	7430	Charlotte	101	" I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . "
7559	7591	7625	7626	Mr. Darcy	89	" You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . "
7853	7860	7862	7862	she	82	" What does Mr. Darcy mean , "
7866	7876	7862	7862	she	82	" by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? "
7877	7889	7862	7862	she	82	" That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer . "
7890	7939	7862	7862	she	82	" But if he does it any more , I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . "
7984	8016	7978	7978	she	92	" Did not you think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? "
8017	8034	7978	7978	she	92	" With great energy ; but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . "
8035	8042	7978	7978	she	92	" You are severe on us . "
8043	8056	8058	8059	Miss Lucas	92	" It will be _ her _ turn soon to be teased , "
8061	8078	8058	8059	Miss Lucas	92	" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . "
8079	8144	8153	8153	she	92	" You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . "
8156	8169	8153	8153	she	92	" Very well ; if it must be so , it must . "
8177	8209	8153	8153	she	92	" There is a very fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I shall keep mine to swell my song . "
8450	8486	8517	8518	Sir William	80	" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing , after all . I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . "
8487	8516	8517	8518	Sir William	80	" Certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world : every savage can dance . "
8522	8528	8529	8529	he	80	" Your friend performs delightfully , "
8543	8561	8529	8529	he	80	" and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr. Darcy . "
8562	8575	8517	8518	Sir William	80	" You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , sir . "
8576	8599	8529	8529	he	80	" Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . Do you often dance at St. James 's ? "
8600	8605	8517	8518	Sir William	80	" Never , sir . "
8606	8621	8529	8529	he	80	" Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? "
8622	8640	8517	8518	Sir William	80	" It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . "
8641	8652	8529	8529	he	80	" You have a house in town , I conclude ? "
8657	8695	8696	8696	He	89	" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself , for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . "
8741	8792	8799	8799	he	89	" My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing ? Mr. Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You can not refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . "
8835	8868	8833	8834	Sir William,--	108	" Indeed , sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . "
8909	8962	8833	8834	Sir William,--	108	" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . "
8963	8970	8972	8972	Elizabeth	82	" Mr. Darcy is all politeness , "
8976	9009	8833	8834	Sir William,--	108	" He is , indeed : but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? "
9044	9054	8833	8834	Sir William,--	108	" I can guess the subject of your reverie . "
9055	9061	8833	8834	Sir William,--	108	" I should imagine not . "
9062	9132	8833	8834	Sir William,--	108	" You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner,--in such society ; and , indeed , I am quite of your opinion . I was never more annoyed ! The insipidity , and yet the noise -- the nothingness , and yet the self - importance , of all these people ! What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! "
9133	9176	8833	8834	Sir William,--	108	" Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . My mind was more agreeably engaged . I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . "
9210	9215	8833	8834	Sir William,--	108	" Miss Elizabeth Bennet . "
9216	9221	9223	9224	Miss Bingley	91	" Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! "
9226	9251	9223	9224	Miss Bingley	91	" I am all astonishment . How long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am I to wish you joy ? "
9252	9298	8833	8834	Sir William,--	108	" That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . A lady 's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment . I knew you would be wishing me joy . "
9299	9344	9223	9224	Miss Bingley	91	" Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . "
9783	9821	9779	9780	Mr. Bennet	75	" From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . "
9870	9878	9880	9881	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I am astonished , my dear , "
9883	9918	9880	9881	Mrs. Bennet	85	" that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . If I wished to think slightingly of anybody 's children , it should not be of my own , however . "
9919	9936	9841	9841	her	84	" If my children are silly , I must hope to be always sensible of it . "
9937	9953	9880	9881	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes ; but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . "
9954	10001	9841	9841	her	84	" This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . "
10002	10121	9880	9881	Mrs. Bennet	85	" My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William 's in his regimentals . "
10122	10125	10127	10127	Lydia	84	" Mamma , "
10129	10168	10127	10127	Lydia	84	" my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson 's as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke 's library . "
10219	10255	10209	10209	she	85	" Well , Jane , who is it from ? What is it about ? What does he say ? Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "
10256	10263	10265	10265	Jane	83	" It is from Miss Bingley , "
10276	10282	10209	10209	she	85	" My dear friend , * /
10283	10365	10275	10275	NIND	116	" If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives ; for a whole day 's _ tete - a - tete _ between two women can never end without a quarrel . Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . Yours ever ,
10366	10370	10209	10209	she	85	" CAROLINE BINGLEY . "
10371	10376	10378	10378	Lydia	84	" With the officers ! "
10380	10394	10378	10378	Lydia	84	" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . "
10395	10399	10401	10402	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Dining out , "
10404	10410	10401	10402	Mrs. Bennet	85	" that is very unlucky . "
10411	10418	10420	10420	Jane	83	" Can I have the carriage ? "
10422	10450	10209	10209	she	85	" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . "
10451	10459	10461	10461	Elizabeth	82	" That would be a good scheme , "
10463	10478	10461	10461	Elizabeth	82	" if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . "
10479	10505	10209	10209	she	85	" Oh , but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley 's chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . "
10506	10516	10461	10461	Elizabeth	82	" I had much rather go in the coach . "
10517	10549	10209	10209	she	85	" But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure . They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are not they ? "
10550	10565	10461	10461	Elizabeth	82	" They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . "
10566	10577	10579	10579	Elizabeth	82	" But if you have got them to - day , "
10581	10590	10579	10579	Elizabeth	82	" my mother 's purpose will be answered . "
10678	10689	10691	10692	Mrs. Bennet	85	" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! "
10748	10754	10735	10738	a servant from Netherfield	468	" My dearest Lizzie , * /
10755	10838	10735	10738	a servant from Netherfield	468	" I find myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and , excepting a sore throat and a headache , there is not much the matter with me .
10839	10844	10735	10738	a servant from Netherfield	468	" Yours , etc . "
10845	10851	10853	10854	Mr. Bennet	75	" Well , my dear , "
10864	10903	10853	10854	Mr. Bennet	75	" if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if she should die -- it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . "
10904	10960	10961	10961	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , I am not at all afraid of her dying . People do not die of little trifling colds . She will be taken good care of . As long as she stays there , it is all very well . I would go and see her if I could have the carriage . "
11000	11008	11010	11011	her mother	241	" How can you be so silly , "
11013	11040	10995	10995	She	82	" as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . "
11041	11057	11010	11011	her mother	241	" I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want . "
11058	11068	11070	11071	her father	244	" Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , "
11073	11080	11070	11071	her father	244	" to send for the horses ? "
11081	11117	11010	11011	her mother	241	" No , indeed . I do not wish to avoid the walk . The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . I shall be back by dinner . "
11118	11127	11129	11129	Mary	87	" I admire the activity of your benevolence , "
11131	11160	11129	11129	Mary	87	" but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . "
11161	11172	11174	11174	Catherine	86	" We will go as far as Meryton with you , "
11192	11198	11200	11200	Lydia	84	" If we make haste , "
11207	11221	11200	11200	Lydia	84	" perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter , before he goes . "
12131	12164	12123	12124	Mrs. Hurst	90	" She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . I shall never forget her appearance this morning . She really looked almost wild . "
12165	12212	12123	12124	Mrs. Hurst	90	" She did indeed , Louisa . I could hardly keep my countenance . Very nonsensical to come at all ! Why must _ she _ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? Her hair so untidy , so blowzy ! "
12213	12254	12123	12124	Mrs. Hurst	90	" Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain , and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . "
12255	12265	12267	12267	Bingley	91	" Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , "
12269	12303	12267	12267	Bingley	91	" but this was all lost upon me . I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning . Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . "
12304	12318	12320	12321	Miss Bingley	91	" _ You _ observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , "
12323	12346	12320	12321	Miss Bingley	91	" and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _ your sister _ make such an exhibition . "
12347	12351	12267	12267	Bingley	91	" Certainly not . "
12352	12412	12320	12321	Miss Bingley	91	" To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country - town indifference to decorum . "
12413	12426	12428	12428	Bingley	91	" It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , "
12430	12438	12440	12441	Miss Bingley	91	" I am afraid , Mr. Darcy , "
12448	12462	12440	12441	Miss Bingley	91	" that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . "
12463	12468	12469	12469	he	511	" Not at all , "
12472	12480	12469	12469	he	511	" they were brightened by the exercise . "
12493	12542	12440	12441	Miss Bingley	91	" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . "
12543	12560	12440	12441	Miss Bingley	91	" I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton ? "
12561	12575	12440	12441	Miss Bingley	91	" Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . "
12576	12581	12583	12584	her sister	328	" That is capital , "
12592	12605	12607	12607	Bingley	91	" If they had uncles enough to fill _ all _ Cheapside , "
12609	12620	12607	12607	Bingley	91	" it would not make them one jot less agreeable . "
12621	12640	12642	12642	Darcy	89	" But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , "
12826	12834	12836	12836	he	88	" Do you prefer reading to cards ? "
12838	12844	12836	12836	he	88	" that is rather singular . "
12845	12850	12852	12853	Miss Bingley	91	" Miss Eliza Bennet , "
12855	12873	12852	12853	Miss Bingley	91	" despises cards . She is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . "
12874	12884	12886	12886	Elizabeth	82	" I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , "
12888	12906	12886	12886	Elizabeth	82	" I am _ not _ a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . "
12907	12919	12921	12921	Bingley	91	" In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , "
12923	12938	12921	12921	Bingley	91	" and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . "
12973	13012	13015	13015	him	88	" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow ; and though I have not many , I have more than I ever looked into . "
13028	13033	13035	13036	Miss Bingley	91	" I am astonished , "
13038	13064	13035	13036	Miss Bingley	91	" that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr. Darcy ! "
13065	13072	13073	13073	he	88	" It ought to be good , "
13076	13086	13073	13073	he	88	" it has been the work of many generations . "
13087	13105	13035	13036	Miss Bingley	91	" And then you have added so much to it yourself -- you are always buying books . "
13106	13123	13073	13073	he	88	" I can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . "
13124	13165	13035	13036	Miss Bingley	91	" Neglect ! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . Charles , when you build _ your _ house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . "
13166	13172	13073	13073	he	88	" I wish it may . "
13173	13208	13035	13036	Miss Bingley	91	" But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . "
13209	13227	13073	13073	he	88	" With all my heart : I will buy Pemberley itself , if Darcy will sell it . "
13228	13237	13035	13036	Miss Bingley	91	" I am talking of possibilities , Charles . "
13238	13260	13073	13073	he	88	" Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . "
13313	13323	13325	13326	Miss Bingley	91	" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? "
13328	13338	13325	13326	Miss Bingley	91	" will she be as tall as I am ? "
13339	13359	13325	13326	Miss Bingley	91	" I think she will . She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet 's height , or rather taller . "
13360	13403	13325	13326	Miss Bingley	91	" How I long to see her again ! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . Such a countenance , such manners , and so extremely accomplished for her age ! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite . "
13404	13411	13413	13413	Bingley	79	" It is amazing to me , "
13415	13432	13413	13413	Bingley	79	" how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are . "
13433	13448	13325	13326	Miss Bingley	91	" All young ladies accomplished ! My dear Charles , what do you mean ? "
13449	13509	13413	13413	Bingley	79	" Yes , all of them , I think . They all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses . I scarcely know any one who can not do all this ; and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . "
13510	13520	13522	13522	Darcy	124	" Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , "
13524	13595	13522	13522	Darcy	124	" has too much truth . The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen ; but I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . I can not boast of knowing more than half - a - dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished . "
13596	13604	13606	13607	Miss Bingley	91	" Nor I , I am sure , "
13609	13612	13614	13614	Elizabeth	82	" Then , "
13616	13631	13614	13614	Elizabeth	82	" you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . "
13632	13644	13522	13522	Darcy	124	" Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . "
13645	13650	13652	13654	his faithful assistant	527	" Oh , certainly , "
13656	13741	13652	13654	his faithful assistant	527	" no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with . A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and , besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . "
13742	13749	13751	13751	Darcy	124	" All this she must possess , "
13753	13774	13751	13751	Darcy	124	" and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . "
13775	13802	13652	13654	his faithful assistant	527	" I am no longer surprised at your knowing _ only _ six accomplished women . I rather wonder now at your knowing _ any _ . "
13803	13821	13751	13751	Darcy	124	" Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ? "
13822	13855	13652	13654	his faithful assistant	527	" _ I _ never saw such a woman . _ I _ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . "
13922	13926	13928	13929	Miss Bingley	91	" Eliza Bennet , "
13939	13988	13928	13929	Miss Bingley	91	" is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I daresay , it succeeds ; but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . "
13989	13992	13994	13994	Darcy	124	" Undoubtedly , "
14004	14031	13994	13994	Darcy	124	" there is meanness in _ all _ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . "
14465	14472	14474	14474	her	82	" Indeed I have , sir , "
14477	14510	14474	14474	her	82	" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her . We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . "
14511	14514	14516	14516	Bingley	91	" Removed ! "
14518	14540	14516	14516	Bingley	91	" It must not be thought of . My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . "
14541	14550	14552	14553	Miss Bingley	91	" You may depend upon it , madam , "
14559	14574	14552	14553	Miss Bingley	91	" that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . "
14583	14588	14589	14589	she	85	" I am sure , "
14592	14727	14589	14589	she	85	" if it was not for such good friends , I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with . I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _ her _ . You have a sweet room here , Mr. Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . You will not think of quitting it in a hurry , I hope , though you have but a short lease . "
14728	14738	14740	14740	he	554	" Whatever I do is done in a hurry , "
14742	14775	14740	14740	he	554	" and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . "
14776	14788	14790	14790	Elizabeth	82	" That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , "
14792	14802	14804	14804	he	554	" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? "
14810	14819	14740	14740	he	554	" Oh yes -- I understand you perfectly . "
14820	14846	14740	14740	he	554	" I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through , I am afraid , is pitiful . "
14847	14877	14740	14740	he	554	" That is as it happens . It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . "
14878	14881	14740	14740	he	554	" Lizzy , "
14886	14910	14740	14740	he	554	" remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . "
14911	14918	14920	14920	Bingley	79	" I did not know before , "
14924	14940	14920	14920	Bingley	79	" that you were a studier of character . It must be an amusing study . "
14941	14961	14740	14740	he	554	" Yes ; but intricate characters are the _ most _ amusing . They have at least that advantage . "
14962	14966	14968	14968	Darcy	124	" The country , "
14970	14997	14968	14968	Darcy	124	" can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . "
14998	15019	14740	14740	he	554	" But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . "
15020	15025	15027	15028	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes , indeed , "
15040	15062	15027	15028	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ going on in the country as in town . "
15099	15140	15097	15097	her	85	" I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places . The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr. Bingley ? "
15141	15149	15150	15150	he	79	" When I am in the country , "
15153	15190	15150	15150	he	79	" I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town , it is pretty much the same . They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . "
15191	15207	15097	15097	her	85	" Ay , that is because you have the right disposition . But that gentleman , "
15212	15223	15097	15097	her	85	" seemed to think the country was nothing at all . "
15224	15233	15235	15235	Elizabeth	82	" Indeed , mamma , you are mistaken , "
15242	15280	15235	15235	Elizabeth	82	" You quite mistook Mr. Darcy . He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . "
15281	15324	15346	15346	her	559	" Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . I know we dine with four - and - twenty families . "
15390	15465	15346	15346	her	559	" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr. Bingley -- is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy ! He has always something to say to everybody . _ That _ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter . "
15466	15473	15346	15346	her	559	" Did Charlotte dine with you ? "
15474	15575	15346	15346	her	559	" No , she would go home . I fancy she was wanted about the mince - pies . For my part , Mr. Bingley , _ I _ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _ my _ daughters are brought up differently . But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you . It is a pity they are not handsome ! Not that _ I _ think Charlotte so _ very _ plain ; but then she is our particular friend . "
15576	15585	15587	15587	Bingley	79	" She seems a very pleasant young woman , "
15589	15733	15346	15346	her	559	" Oh dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane 's beauty . I do not like to boast of my own child ; but to be sure , Jane -- one does not often see anybody better looking . It is what everybody says . I do not trust my own partiality . When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner 's in town so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . But , however , he did not . Perhaps he thought her too young . However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . "
15734	15741	15743	15743	Elizabeth	82	" And so ended his affection , "
15747	15778	15743	15743	Elizabeth	82	" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! "
15779	15795	15797	15797	Darcy	89	" I have been used to consider poetry as the _ food _ of love , "
15799	15844	15743	15743	Elizabeth	82	" Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . Everything nourishes what is strong already . But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . "
16160	16211	16146	16146	His	79	" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and , when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball . But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ? "
16217	16259	16260	16260	she	84	" Oh yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well ; and by that time , most likely , Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . And when you have given _ your _ ball , "
16263	16289	16260	16260	she	84	" I shall insist on their giving one also . I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . "
16549	16562	16563	16563	He	89	" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! "
16568	16574	16711	16711	He	585	" You write uncommonly fast . "
16575	16585	16711	16711	He	585	" You are mistaken . I write rather slowly . "
16586	16616	16711	16711	He	585	" How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year ! Letters of business , too ! How odious I should think them ! "
16617	16635	16711	16711	He	585	" It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . "
16636	16648	16711	16711	He	585	" Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . "
16649	16662	16711	16711	He	585	" I have already told her so once , by your desire . "
16663	16687	16711	16711	He	585	" I am afraid you do not like your pen . Let me mend it for you . I mend pens remarkably well . "
16688	16699	16711	16711	He	585	" Thank you -- but I always mend my own . "
16700	16710	16711	16711	He	585	" How can you contrive to write so even ? "
16715	16762	16711	16711	He	585	" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley 's . "
16763	16789	16711	16711	He	585	" Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . "
16790	16821	16711	16711	He	585	" Oh , it is of no consequence . I shall see her in January . But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr. Darcy ? "
16822	16841	16711	16711	He	585	" They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . "
16842	16866	16711	16711	He	585	" It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter with ease can not write ill . "
16867	16880	16711	16711	He	585	" That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , "
16885	16912	16711	16711	He	585	" because he does _ not _ write with ease . He studies too much for words of four syllables . Do not you , Darcy ? "
16913	16924	16711	16711	He	585	" My style of writing is very different from yours . "
16925	16928	16930	16931	Miss Bingley	91	" Oh , "
16933	16955	16930	16931	Miss Bingley	91	" Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . "
16956	16986	16711	16711	He	585	" My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them ; by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . "
16987	16994	16996	16996	Elizabeth	82	" Your humility , Mr. Bingley , "
16998	17003	16996	16996	Elizabeth	82	" must disarm reproof . "
17004	17010	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" Nothing is more deceitful , "
17014	17035	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" than the appearance of humility . It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . "
17036	17054	16711	16711	He	585	" And which of the two do you call _ my _ little recent piece of modesty ? "
17055	17198	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning , that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself ; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ? "
17199	17202	17204	17204	Bingley	79	" Nay , "
17206	17275	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . "
17276	17367	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" I daresay you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it -- you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month . "
17368	17376	17378	17378	Elizabeth	82	" You have only proved by this , "
17380	17406	17378	17378	Elizabeth	82	" that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . You have shown him off now much more than he did himself . "
17407	17413	17415	17415	Bingley	79	" I am exceedingly gratified , "
17417	17487	17415	17415	Bingley	79	" by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me if , under such a circumstance , I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . "
17488	17511	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? "
17512	17531	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" Upon my word , I can not exactly explain the matter -- Darcy must speak for himself . "
17532	17612	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . "
17613	17634	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" To yield readily -- easily -- to the _ persuasion _ of a friend is no merit with you . "
17635	17649	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . "
17650	17787	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" You appear to me , Mr. Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley . We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . But in general and ordinary cases , between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? "
17788	17832	17012	17012	Darcy	89	" Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? "
17833	17838	17840	17840	Bingley	79	" By all means , "
17842	17947	17840	17840	Bingley	79	" let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size , for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . "
17991	17999	18001	18002	his friend	286	" I see your design , Bingley , "
18004	18016	18001	18002	his friend	286	" You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . "
18017	18062	18091	18092	Mr. Darcy	89	" Perhaps I do . Arguments are too much like disputes . If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . "
18063	18068	18070	18070	Elizabeth	82	" What you ask , "
18072	18090	18070	18070	Elizabeth	82	" is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter . "
18328	18350	18318	18319	Mr. Darcy	89	" Do you not feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? "
18371	18374	18376	18376	she	82	" Oh , "
18378	18472	18376	18376	she	82	" I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all ; and now despise me if you dare . "
18473	18480	18506	18506	her	82	" Indeed I do not dare . "
18619	18623	18625	18625	she	82	" I hope , "
18639	18716	18625	18625	she	82	" you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , to cure the younger girls of running after the officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . "
18717	18729	18625	18625	she	82	" Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? "
18730	18805	18625	18625	she	82	" Oh yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . Put them next to your great - uncle the judge . They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines . As for your Elizabeth 's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? "
18806	18838	18625	18625	she	82	" It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression ; but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . "
18855	18866	18868	18869	Miss Bingley	91	" I did not know that you intended to walk , "
18881	18888	18890	18891	Mrs. Hurst	90	" You used us abominably ill , "
18893	18905	18890	18891	Mrs. Hurst	90	" running away without telling us that you were coming out . "
18938	18957	18929	18930	Mr. Darcy	89	" This walk is not wide enough for our party . We had better go into the avenue . "
18974	19009	19010	19010	She	82	" No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage . The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . Good - bye . "
19214	19218	19212	19212	he	89	" very glad ; "
19550	19609	19542	19542	she	91	" How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! I declare , after all , there is no enjoyment like reading ! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . "
19658	19719	19651	19651	she	91	" By the bye Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . "
19720	19726	19728	19729	her brother	3108	" If you mean Darcy , "
19731	19776	19651	19651	she	91	" he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins ; but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing , and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . "
19777	19785	19786	19786	she	91	" I should like balls infinitely better , "
19789	19834	19786	19786	she	91	" if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . "
19835	19860	19651	19651	she	91	" Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say ; but it would not be near so much like a ball . "
19924	19961	19910	19910	she	91	" Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . "
20087	20092	20094	20094	her	82	" Not at all , "
20097	20127	20094	20094	her	82	" but , depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it . "
20156	20167	20169	20169	he	89	" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , "
20180	20252	20169	20169	he	89	" You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other 's confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking : if the first , I should be completely in your way ; and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . "
20253	20258	20260	20261	Miss Bingley	91	" Oh , shocking ! "
20263	20281	20260	20261	Miss Bingley	91	" I never heard anything so abominable . How shall we punish him for such a speech ? "
20282	20294	20296	20296	Elizabeth	82	" Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , "
20298	20330	20296	20296	Elizabeth	82	" We can all plague and punish one another . Tease him -- laugh at him . Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . "
20331	20408	20260	20261	Miss Bingley	91	" But upon my honour I do _ not _ . I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ . Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind ! No , no ; I feel he may defy us there . And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . Mr. Darcy may hug himself . "
20409	20419	20421	20421	Elizabeth	82	" Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! "
20423	20461	20421	20421	Elizabeth	82	" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _ me _ to have many such acquaintance . I dearly love a laugh . "
20462	20466	20468	20468	he	626	" Miss Bingley , "
20470	20510	20468	20468	he	626	" has given me credit for more than can be . The wisest and best of men,--nay , the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . "
20511	20514	20516	20516	Elizabeth	82	" Certainly , "
20518	20586	20516	20516	Elizabeth	82	" there are such people , but I hope I am not one of _ them _ . I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , _ do _ divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . "
20587	20618	20421	20421	Elizabeth	82	" Perhaps that is not possible for anyone . But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . "
20619	20626	20516	20516	Elizabeth	82	" Such as vanity and pride . "
20627	20656	20421	20421	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind -- pride will be always under good regulation . "
20665	20677	20679	20680	Miss Bingley	91	" Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , "
20682	20690	20679	20680	Miss Bingley	91	" and pray what is the result ? "
20691	20712	20516	20516	Elizabeth	82	" I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect . He owns it himself without disguise . "
20713	20716	20718	20718	Darcy	89	" No , "
20720	20825	20718	20718	Darcy	89	" I have made no such pretension . I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . My temper I dare not vouch for . It is , I believe , too little yielding ; certainly too little for the convenience of the world . I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . "
20826	20836	20838	20838	Elizabeth	82	" _ That _ is a failing , indeed ! "
20840	20876	20838	20838	Elizabeth	82	" Implacable resentment _ is _ a shade in a character . But you have chosen your fault well . I really can not _ laugh _ at it . You are safe from me . "
20877	20907	20718	20718	Darcy	89	" There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . "
20908	20921	20838	20838	Elizabeth	82	" And _ your _ defect is a propensity to hate everybody . "
20922	20926	20927	20927	he	627	" And yours , "
20934	20941	20927	20927	he	627	" is wilfully to misunderstand them . "
20942	20951	20953	20954	Miss Bingley	91	" Do let us have a little music , "
20967	20979	20953	20954	Miss Bingley	91	" Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst . "
21791	21798	21800	21801	Mr. Bennet	75	" I hope , my dear , "
21815	21840	21800	21801	Mr. Bennet	75	" that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . "
21841	21895	21911	21912	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Who do you mean , my dear ? I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in ; and I hope _ my _ dinners are good enough for her . I do not believe she often sees such at home . "
21896	21910	21800	21801	Mr. Bennet	75	" The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger . "
21917	22003	21911	21912	Mrs. Bennet	85	" A gentleman and a stranger ! It is Mr. Bingley , I am sure . Why , Jane -- you never dropped a word of this -- you sly thing ! Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley . But -- good Lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . Lydia , my love , ring the bell . I must speak to Hill this moment . "
22004	22013	22015	22016	her husband	255	" It is _ not _ Mr. Bingley , "
22018	22035	22015	22016	her husband	255	" it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . "
22071	22134	22062	22062	himself	255	explained:--"About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it ; for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . It is from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . "
22135	22141	22143	22144	his wife	231	" Oh , my dear , "
22146	22214	22143	22144	his wife	231	" I can not bear to hear that mentioned . Pray do not talk of that odious man . I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure , if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . "
22284	22293	22295	22296	Mr. Bennet	75	" It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , "
22298	22337	22295	22296	Mr. Bennet	75	" and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may , perhaps , be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . "
22338	22392	22253	22253	she	85	" No , that I am sure I shall not : and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . I hate such false friends . Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? "
22393	22416	22295	22296	Mr. Bennet	75	" Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . "
22420	22434	22295	22296	Mr. Bennet	75	" Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , _ 15th October _ . * /
22435	22438	22253	22253	she	85	" Dear Sir ,
22439	22522	22524	22525	Mrs. Bennet	85	" The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness ; and , since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach : but , for some time , I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance . "--'There
22527	22861	22524	22525	Mrs. Bennet	85	'--"My mind , however , is now made up on the subject ; for , having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England . As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good - will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch . I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologize for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends ; but of this hereafter . If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'nnight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day . I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend ,
22862	22866	22889	22889	he	75	" WILLIAM COLLINS . "
22867	22883	22889	22889	he	75	" At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , "
22895	22941	22889	22889	he	75	" He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and , I doubt not , will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . "
22942	22979	22889	22889	he	75	" There is some sense in what he says about the girls , however ; and , if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . "
22980	22986	22988	22988	Jane	83	" Though it is difficult , "
22990	23017	22988	22988	Jane	83	" to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . "
23048	23058	23060	23060	she	82	" He must be an oddity , I think , "
23062	23115	23060	23060	she	82	" I can not make him out . There is something very pompous in his style . And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? We can not suppose he would help it , if he could . Can he be a sensible man , sir ? "
23116	23161	23060	23060	she	82	" No , my dear ; I think not . I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse . There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter which promises well . I am impatient to see him . "
23162	23168	23170	23170	Mary	87	" In point of composition , "
23172	23200	23170	23170	Mary	87	" his letter does not seem defective . The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . "
23466	23504	23454	23455	Mrs. Bennet	85	" You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . Things are settled so oddly . "
23505	23518	23454	23455	Mrs. Bennet	85	" You allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate . "
23519	23584	23454	23455	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Ah , sir , I do indeed . It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . Not that I mean to find fault with _ you _ , for such things , I know , are all chance in this world . There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . "
23585	23652	23454	23455	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . At present I will not say more , but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted---- "
24162	24175	24177	24178	Mrs. Bennet	85	" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , "
24180	24215	24177	24178	Mrs. Bennet	85	" and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . Does she live near you , sir ? "
24216	24240	24136	24136	she	85	" The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her Ladyship 's residence . "
24241	24258	24177	24178	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? "
24259	24277	24136	24136	she	85	" She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . "
24278	24281	24283	24284	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Ah , "
24290	24313	24287	24287	her	85	" then she is better off than many girls . And what sort of young lady is she ? Is she handsome ? "
24314	24434	24136	24136	she	85	" She is a most charming young lady , indeed . Lady Catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of , as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "
24435	24453	24287	24287	her	85	" Has she been presented ? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . "
24454	24591	24136	24136	she	85	" Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British Court of its brightest ornament . Her Ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess ; and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . "
24592	24598	24600	24601	Mr. Bennet	75	" You judge very properly , "
24603	24643	24600	24601	Mr. Bennet	75	" and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? "
24644	24691	24692	24693	Mr. Bennet	75	" They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time ; and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . "
24858	24863	24864	24864	Lydia	84	" Fordyce 's Sermons . "
24890	24952	24886	24886	she	84	" Do you know , mamma , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard ? and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town . "
24980	25035	24967	24968	Mr. Collins	129	" I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . It amazes me , I confess ; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . But I will no longer importune my young cousin . "
25568	25628	25562	25562	Jane	83	" As to her _ younger _ daughters , she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _ know _ of any prepossession;--her _ eldest _ daughter she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . "
26828	26834	26837	26837	them	3045	" stupid , disagreeable fellows . "
27744	27754	27756	27756	he	136	" I know little of the game at present , "
27758	27774	27756	27756	he	136	" but I shall be glad to improve myself ; for in my situation of life---- "
27980	27985	27987	27987	Elizabeth	82	" About a month , "
28001	28016	27987	27987	Elizabeth	82	" he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . "
28017	28020	28022	28022	Wickham	136	" Yes , "
28024	28079	28022	28022	Wickham	136	" his estate there is a noble one . A clear ten thousand per annum . You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for I have been connected with his family , in a particular manner , from my infancy . "
28087	28127	27987	27987	Elizabeth	82	" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy ? "
28128	28138	28140	28140	Elizabeth	82	" As much as I ever wish to be , "
28144	28164	28140	28140	Elizabeth	82	" I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . "
28165	28177	28179	28179	Wickham	136	" I have no right to give _ my _ opinion , "
28181	28259	28179	28179	Wickham	136	" as to his being agreeable or otherwise . I am not qualified to form one . I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . It is impossible for _ me _ to be impartial . But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and , perhaps , you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . "
28260	28313	28140	28140	Elizabeth	82	" Upon my word I say no more _ here _ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . Everybody is disgusted with his pride . You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . "
28314	28323	28325	28325	Wickham	136	" I can not pretend to be sorry , "
28332	28390	28325	28325	Wickham	136	" that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _ him _ I believe it does not often happen . The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . "
28391	28413	28140	28140	Elizabeth	82	" I should take him , even on _ my _ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . "
28420	28424	28426	28426	he	136	" I wonder , "
28435	28448	28426	28426	he	136	" whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . "
28449	28493	28140	28140	Elizabeth	82	" I do not at all know ; but I _ heard _ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . "
28494	28671	28426	28426	he	136	" Oh no -- it is not for _ me _ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy . If _ he _ wishes to avoid seeing _ me _ he must go . We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding _ him _ but what I might proclaim to all the world -- a sense of very great ill - usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr. Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . "
28741	28754	28755	28755	he	136	" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , "
28758	28909	28755	28755	he	136	" which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire . I know it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps ; and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . Society , I own , is necessary to me . I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . I _ must _ have employment and society . A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . The church _ ought _ to have been my profession -- I was brought up for the church ; and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . "
28910	28913	28697	28698	Mr. Wickham	136	" Indeed ! "
28914	28980	28755	28755	he	136	" Yes -- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . I can not do justice to his kindness . He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . "
28981	28985	28987	28987	Elizabeth	82	" Good heavens ! "
28989	29013	28987	28987	Elizabeth	82	" but how could _ that _ be ? How could his will be disregarded ? Why did not you seek legal redress ? "
29014	29200	28755	28755	he	136	" There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short , anything or nothing . Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it . I have a warm unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _ of _ him , and _ to _ him , too freely . I can recall nothing worse . But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "
29201	29214	28987	28987	Elizabeth	82	" This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly disgraced . "
29215	29253	28755	28755	he	136	" Some time or other he _ will _ be -- but it shall not be by _ me _ . Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose _ him _ . "
29272	29276	29278	29278	she	82	" But what , "
29284	29301	29278	29278	she	82	" can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? "
29302	29388	28987	28987	Elizabeth	82	" A thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which I can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy . Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father 's uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life . He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me . "
29389	29452	29278	29278	she	82	" I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this -- though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him -- I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! "
29465	29499	29462	29462	she	846	" I _ do _ remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . His disposition must be dreadful . "
29500	29510	29512	29512	Wickham	136	" I will not trust myself on the subject , "
29514	29525	29512	29512	Wickham	136	" _ I _ can hardly be just to him . "
29539	29558	29526	29526	Elizabeth	82	" To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! "
29564	29586	29526	29526	Elizabeth	82	" A young man , too , like _ you _ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable . "
29591	29620	29462	29462	she	846	with--"And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner . "
29621	29796	29860	29860	Wickham	136	" We were born in the same parish , within the same park ; the greatest part of our youth was passed together : inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . _ My _ father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Philips , appears to do so much credit to ; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father 's active superintendence ; and when , immediately before my father 's death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ as of affection to myself . "
29797	29801	29803	29803	Elizabeth	82	" How strange ! "
29805	29850	29803	29803	Elizabeth	82	" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you . If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . "
29851	29858	29860	29860	Wickham	136	" It _ is _ wonderful , "
29862	29917	29860	29860	Wickham	136	" for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride has often been his best friend . It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . "
29918	29931	29860	29860	Wickham	136	" Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good ? "
29932	30065	29860	29860	Wickham	136	" Yes ; it has often led him to be liberal and generous ; to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . Family pride , and _ filial _ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . He has also _ brotherly _ pride , which , with _ some _ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . "
30066	30076	29860	29860	Wickham	136	" What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? "
30082	30191	30079	30079	his	847	" I wish I could call her amiable . It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy ; but she is too much like her brother,--very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . But she is nothing to me now . She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished . Since her father 's death her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . "
30215	30269	29860	29860	Wickham	136	" I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley . How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good - humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr. Bingley ? "
30270	30275	30394	30396	The whist party	848	" Not at all . "
30276	30298	29860	29860	Wickham	136	" He is a sweet - tempered , amiable , charming man . He can not know what Mr. Darcy is . "
30299	30393	30394	30396	The whist party	848	" Probably not ; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses . He does not want abilities . He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and , perhaps , agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure . "
30498	30506	30508	30508	he	129	" I know very well , madam , "
30510	30577	30508	30508	he	129	" that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . There are , undoubtedly , many who could not say the same ; but , thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . "
30616	30622	30623	30623	she	82	" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , "
30626	30657	30623	30623	she	82	" has very lately given him a living . I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . "
30658	30686	30595	30595	he	129	" You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy . "
30687	30719	30623	30623	she	82	" No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine 's connections . I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . "
30720	30750	30782	30782	her	91	" Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . "
30797	30801	30803	30803	she	82	" Mr. Collins , "
30805	30855	30803	30803	she	82	" speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but , from some particulars that he has related of her Ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him ; and that , in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . "
30856	30868	30870	30870	Wickham	136	" I believe her to be both in a great degree , "
30872	30961	30870	30870	Wickham	136	" I have not seen her for many years ; but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . "
31308	31313	31315	31315	she	83	" They have both , "
31317	31377	31315	31315	she	83	" been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . "
31378	31431	31315	31315	she	83	" Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear _ them _ , too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . "
31432	31529	31315	31315	she	83	" Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father 's favourite in such a manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? Oh no . "
31530	31591	31315	31315	she	83	" I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley 's being imposed on than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it . Besides , there was truth in his looks . "
31592	31611	31315	31315	she	83	" It is difficult , indeed -- it is distressing . One does not know what to think . "
31612	31623	31315	31315	she	83	" I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . "
31995	32005	32007	32007	she	87	" While I can have my mornings to myself , "
32009	32053	32007	32007	she	87	" it is enough . I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . "
32152	32165	32167	32167	he	129	" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , "
32169	32270	32167	32167	he	129	" that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially ; a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . "
32853	32880	32884	32884	his	136	" I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . "
33264	33275	33258	33258	Charlotte	101	" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . "
33276	33311	33258	33258	Charlotte	101	" Heaven forbid ! _ That _ would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . "
33501	33548	33493	33493	she	82	" It is _ your _ turn to say something now , Mr. Darcy . _ I _ talked about the dance , and _ you _ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . "
33566	33608	33493	33493	she	82	" Very well ; that reply will do for the present . Perhaps , by - and - by , I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones ; but _ now _ we may be silent . "
33609	33623	33493	33493	she	82	" Do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing ? "
33624	33681	33493	33493	she	82	" Sometimes . One must speak a little , you know . It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet , for the advantage of _ some _ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . "
33682	33704	33493	33493	she	82	" Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? "
33705	33708	33710	33710	Elizabeth	82	" Both , "
33713	33772	33710	33710	Elizabeth	82	" for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the _ eclat _ of a proverb . "
33773	33789	33791	33791	he	908	" This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , "
33793	33822	33791	33791	he	908	" How near it may be to _ mine _ , I can not pretend to say . _ You _ think it a faithful portrait , undoubtedly . "
33823	33833	33834	33834	He	908	" I must not decide on my own performance . "
33885	33904	33869	33869	She	82	" When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . "
33955	33989	33946	33946	Darcy	89	" Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his _ making _ friends ; whether he may be equally capable of _ retaining _ them , is less certain . "
33990	34002	34004	34004	Elizabeth	82	" He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , "
34009	34025	34004	34004	Elizabeth	82	" and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . "
34091	34222	34071	34071	he	80	" I have been most highly gratified , indeed , my dear sir ; such very superior dancing is not often seen . It is evident that you belong to the first circles . Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you : and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza ( glancing at her sister and Bingley ) , shall take place . What congratulations will then flow in ! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you , sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . "
34286	34301	34278	34278	he	80	" Sir William 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . "
34302	34357	34278	34278	he	80	" I do not think we were speaking at all . Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I can not imagine . "
34358	34365	34367	34367	he	80	" What think you of books ? "
34371	34391	34278	34278	he	80	" Books -- oh no!--I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . "
34392	34424	34278	34278	he	80	" I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may compare our different opinions . "
34425	34449	34278	34278	he	80	" No -- I can not talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else . "
34450	34465	34467	34467	he	80	" The _ present _ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ? "
34475	34480	34481	34481	she	916	" Yes , always , "
34509	34550	34505	34505	her	916	" I remember hearing you once say , Mr. Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment , once created , was unappeasable . You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its _ being created _ ? "
34551	34555	34557	34557	he	80	" I am , "
34564	34575	34505	34505	her	916	" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? "
34576	34581	34505	34505	her	916	" I hope not . "
34582	34604	34505	34505	her	916	" It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . "
34605	34615	34505	34505	her	916	" May I ask to what these questions tend ? "
34616	34627	34629	34629	she	916	" Merely to the illustration of _ your _ character , "
34638	34647	34629	34629	she	916	" I am trying to make it out . "
34648	34655	34505	34505	her	916	" And what is your success ? "
34661	34682	34656	34656	She	916	" I do not get on at all . I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . "
34683	34689	34691	34691	he	80	" I can readily believe , "
34695	34743	34691	34691	he	80	" that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . "
34744	34762	34656	34656	She	916	" But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . "
34763	34775	34776	34776	he	80	" I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , "
34861	35118	34843	34844	Miss Bingley	91	" So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ? Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy 's steward . Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for , as to Mr. Darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false : for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame ; that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned ; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . "
35119	35136	35138	35138	Elizabeth	82	" His guilt and his descent appear , by your account , to be the same , "
35142	35180	35138	35138	Elizabeth	82	" for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy 's steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself . "
35181	35187	35189	35190	Miss Bingley	91	" I beg your pardon , "
35198	35208	35189	35190	Miss Bingley	91	" Excuse my interference ; it was kindly meant . "
35209	35213	35215	35215	Elizabeth	82	" Insolent girl ! "
35219	35255	35215	35215	Elizabeth	82	" You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . "
35350	35356	35358	35358	she	83	" I want to know , "
35371	35406	35358	35358	she	83	" what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham . But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person , in which case you may be sure of my pardon . "
35407	35410	35412	35412	Jane	83	" No , "
35414	35541	35412	35412	Jane	83	" I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour , of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account , as well as his sister 's , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy 's regard . "
35542	35552	35358	35358	she	83	" Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself . "
35553	35567	35412	35412	Jane	83	" No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . "
35568	35595	35358	35358	she	83	" This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy . I am perfectly satisfied . But what does he say of the living ? "
35596	35631	35412	35412	Jane	83	" He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _ conditionally _ only . "
35632	35644	35646	35646	Elizabeth	82	" I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley 's sincerity , "
35649	35715	35646	35646	Elizabeth	82	" but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . Mr. Bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . "
35830	35836	35838	35838	he	129	" I have found out , "
35840	35977	35838	35838	he	129	" by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness . I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh , and of her mother , Lady Catherine . How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! Who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "
35978	35990	36051	36051	him	923	" You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy ? "
35991	36038	35838	35838	he	129	" Indeed I am . I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . I believe him to be Lady Catherine 's _ nephew _ . It will be in my power to assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight . "
36138	36318	36324	36324	he	926	" My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . You must , therefore , allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which lead me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself ; "
36391	36394	36387	36387	his	926	" apology , "
36395	36398	36387	36387	his	926	" Hunsford , "
36400	36406	36387	36387	his	926	" Lady Catherine de Bourgh . "
36502	36512	36514	36514	he	129	" I have no reason , I assure you , "
36516	36592	36514	36514	he	129	" to be dissatisfied with my reception . Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . It was really a very handsome thought . Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . "
37071	37115	37062	37063	Her mother	241	" What is Mr. Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _ he _ may not like to hear . "
37116	37151	37196	37197	Mr. Darcy	89	" For heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . "
37567	37593	37550	37550	He	244	" That will do extremely well , child . You have delighted us long enough . Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . "
37639	37643	37645	37646	Mr. Collins	129	" If I , "
37648	37875	37645	37646	Mr. Collins	129	" were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family . "
38527	38535	38514	38514	Lydia	84	" Lord , how tired I am ! "
38865	38900	38858	38858	he	129	" May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? "
38917	38952	38959	38959	she	82	" Oh dear ! Yes , certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you upstairs . "
38968	39009	38965	38965	Elizabeth	82	" Dear ma'am , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr. Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear . I am going away myself . "
39010	39028	39046	39046	she	82	" No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you will stay where you are . "
39049	39064	39046	39046	she	82	" Lizzy , I _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . "
39141	39305	39138	39139	Mr. Collins	129	" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother 's permission for this address . You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . "
39352	39925	39350	39350	he	129	" My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and , thirdly , which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss De Bourgh 's footstool,--that she said , ' Mr. Collins , you must marry . A clergyman like you must marry . Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for _ my _ sake , and for your _ own _ ; let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . This is my advice . Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . , which will not be yours till after your mother 's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent : and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . "
39935	39943	39944	39944	she	997	" You are too hasty , sir , "
39947	40002	39944	39944	she	997	" You forget that I have made no answer . Let me do it without further loss of time . Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . "
40003	40011	40013	40014	Mr. Collins	129	" I am not now to learn , "
40024	40097	40013	40014	Mr. Collins	129	" that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . I am , therefore , by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . "
40098	40105	40107	40107	Elizabeth	82	" Upon my word , sir , "
40109	40226	40107	40107	Elizabeth	82	" your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make _ me _ happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _ you _ so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . "
40227	40238	40240	40241	Mr. Collins	129	" Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , "
40244	40292	40240	40241	Mr. Collins	129	gravely--"but I can not imagine that her Ladyship would at all disapprove of you . And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . "
40293	40404	40408	40408	she	998	" Indeed , Mr. Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . "
40426	40519	40421	40422	Mr. Collins	129	" When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and , perhaps , you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . "
40520	40526	40528	40528	Elizabeth	82	" Really , Mr. Collins , "
40534	40577	40528	40528	Elizabeth	82	" you puzzle me exceedingly . If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . "
40578	40768	40421	40422	Mr. Collins	129	" You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course . My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration that , in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . Your portion is unhappily so small , that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . As I must , therefore , conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . "
40769	40872	40528	40528	Elizabeth	82	" I do assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . My feelings in every respect forbid it . Can I speak plainer ? Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . "
40873	40879	40881	40881	he	1001	" You are uniformly charming ! "
40890	40918	40881	40881	he	1001	" and I am persuaded that , when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . "
41179	41188	41189	41189	she	85	" But depend upon it , Mr. Collins , "
41192	41238	41189	41189	she	85	" that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . I will speak to her about it myself directly . She is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will _ make _ her know it . "
41239	41248	41250	41251	Mr. Collins	129	" Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , "
41253	41335	41250	41251	Mr. Collins	129	" but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . If , therefore , she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because , if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . "
41336	41344	41346	41347	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Sir , you quite misunderstand me , "
41351	41399	41346	41347	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . In everything else she is as good - natured a girl as ever lived . I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . "
41424	41480	41481	41482	Mr. Bennet	75	" Oh , Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him ; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . "
41515	41525	41527	41527	he	75	" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , "
41536	41543	41527	41527	he	75	" Of what are you talking ? "
41544	41573	41625	41626	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy . Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . "
41574	41591	41527	41527	he	75	" And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems a hopeless business . "
41592	41610	41625	41626	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Speak to Lizzy about it yourself . Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . "
41611	41624	41527	41527	he	75	" Let her be called down . She shall hear my opinion . "
41640	41646	41651	41651	she	82	" Come here , child , "
41654	41683	41651	41651	she	82	" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage . Is it true ? "
41690	41703	41625	41626	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ? "
41704	41710	41625	41626	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I have , sir . "
41711	41738	41625	41626	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Very well . We now come to the point . Your mother insists upon your accepting it . Is it not so , Mrs. Bennet ? "
41739	41750	41625	41626	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes , or I will never see her again . "
41751	41805	41625	41626	Mrs. Bennet	85	" An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do _ not _ marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you _ do _ . "
41842	41869	41821	41822	Mrs. Bennet	85	" What do you mean , Mr. Bennet , by talking in this way ? You promised me to _ insist _ upon her marrying him . "
41870	41874	41876	41877	her husband	255	" My dear , "
41879	41930	41876	41877	her husband	255	" I have two small favours to request . First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and , secondly , of my room . I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . "
42127	42167	42113	42113	Lydia	84	" I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . "
42239	42248	42249	42249	she	85	" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , "
42257	42283	42249	42249	she	85	" for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me ; I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . "
42297	42304	42306	42307	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Ay , there she comes , "
42309	42514	42306	42307	Mrs. Bennet	85	" looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . _ I _ shall not be able to keep you -- and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . Not that I have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody . People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . Those who do not complain are never pitied . "
42580	42612	42575	42575	she	1024	" Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together . "
42694	42700	42687	42688	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Oh , Mr. Collins ! "
42701	42706	42708	42708	he	129	" My dear madam , "
42710	42727	42728	42728	he	129	" let us be for ever silent on this point . Far be it from me , "
42740	42977	42728	42728	he	129	" to resent the behaviour of your daughter . Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all : the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been , in early preferment ; and , I trust , I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed , that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own ; but we are all liable to error . I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family ; and if my _ manner _ has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologize . "
43254	43258	43260	43260	he	129	" I found , "
43262	43314	43260	43260	he	129	" as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . "
43556	43607	43547	43547	Jane	83	" This is from Caroline Bingley : what it contains has surprised me a good deal . The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . You shall hear what she says . "
43657	43726	43733	43733	Elizabeth	82	words:--"'I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . I depend on you for that . ' "
43806	43811	43813	43813	she	82	" It is unlucky , "
43820	43895	43813	43813	she	82	" that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . But may we not hope that the period of future happiness , to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them . "
43896	43918	43789	43789	she	82	" Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . I will read it to you .
43919	44087	43813	43813	she	82	" ' When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter : I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the crowd , but of that I despair . I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you . '
44088	44095	44097	44097	Jane	83	" It is evident by this , "
44099	44109	44097	44097	Jane	83	" that he comes back no more this winter . "
44110	44126	43813	43813	she	82	" It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _ should _ . "
44127	44406	44408	44408	Jane	83	" Why will you think so ? It must be his own doing ; he is his own master . But you do not know _ all _ . I _ will _ read you the passage which particularly hurts me . I will have no reserves from _ you _ . ' Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and to confess the truth , _ we _ are scarcely less eager to meet her again . I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart . With all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? ' What think you of _ this _ sentence , my dear Lizzy ? "
44415	44486	44408	44408	Jane	83	" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard . Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? "
44487	44504	43813	43813	she	82	" Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? "
44505	44509	44408	44408	Jane	83	" Most willingly . "
44510	44565	43813	43813	she	82	" You shall have it in a few words . Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "
44571	44792	44408	44408	Jane	83	" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection ; Miss Bingley , I am sure , can not : she is not such a simpleton . Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ inter - marriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that , because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday ; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . "
44793	44802	44804	44804	Jane	83	" If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , "
44806	44851	44804	44804	Jane	83	" your representation of all this might make me quite easy . But I know the foundation is unjust . Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . "
44852	44901	44408	44408	Jane	83	" That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine : believe her to be deceived , by all means . You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . "
44902	44935	44804	44804	Jane	83	" But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "
44936	44943	44945	44945	Elizabeth	82	" You must decide for yourself , "
44947	44989	44945	44945	Elizabeth	82	" and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you , by all means , to refuse him . "
44990	44997	44999	44999	Jane	83	" How can you talk so ? "
45004	45026	44999	44999	Jane	83	" you must know , that , though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . "
45027	45051	44945	44945	Elizabeth	82	" I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . "
45052	45078	44999	44999	Jane	83	" But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . A thousand things may arise in six months . "
45373	45381	45383	45383	she	82	" It keeps him in good humour , "
45385	45398	45383	45383	she	82	" and I am more obliged to you than I can express . "
46359	46364	46365	46365	he	129	" My dear madam , "
46368	46404	46365	46365	he	129	" this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . "
46428	46460	46405	46405	They	249	" But is there not danger of Lady Catherine 's disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness . "
46461	46466	46468	46469	Mr. Collins	129	" My dear sir , "
46471	46501	46468	46469	Mr. Collins	129	" I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her Ladyship 's concurrence . "
46502	46560	46405	46405	They	249	" You can not be too much on your guard . Risk anything rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _ we _ shall take no offence . "
46561	46651	46675	46676	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and , depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . "
46872	46884	46866	46866	she	82	" Engaged to Mr. Collins ! my dear Charlotte , impossible ! "
46931	46973	46922	46922	she	82	" Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? "
47021	47029	47031	47031	Charlotte	101	" I see what you are feeling , "
47033	47136	47031	47031	Charlotte	101	" you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . I am not romantic , you know . I never was . I ask only a comfortable home ; and , considering Mr. Collins 's character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . "
47140	47143	47137	47137	Elizabeth	82	" undoubtedly ; "
47427	47454	47417	47417	Lydia	84	" Good Lord ! Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? "
48922	48928	48930	48930	she	101	" Indeed , Mr. Bennet , "
48932	48976	48930	48930	she	101	" it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that _ I _ should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take my place in it ! "
48977	49010	49030	49030	she	101	" My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . Let us hope for better things . Let us flatter ourselves that _ I _ may be the survivor . "
49036	49065	49030	49030	she	101	" I can not bear to think that they should have all this estate . If it was not for the entail , I should not mind it . "
49066	49073	49030	49030	she	101	" What should not you mind ? "
49074	49083	49030	49030	she	101	" I should not mind anything at all . "
49084	49100	49030	49030	she	101	" Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "
49101	49161	49030	49030	she	101	" I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail . How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one 's own daughters I can not understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins , too ! Why should _ he _ have it more than anybody else ? "
49162	49171	49173	49174	Mr. Bennet	75	" I leave it to yourself to determine , "
49674	49731	49669	49669	she	83	" O that my dear mother had more command over herself ! she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . But I will not repine . It can not last long . He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . "
49745	49750	49752	49752	Jane	83	" You doubt me , "
49757	49824	49752	49752	Jane	83	" indeed , you have no reason . He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all . I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . Thank God I have not _ that _ pain . A little time , therefore -- I shall certainly try to get the better---- "
49833	49867	49829	49829	she	83	" I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself . "
49868	49873	49875	49875	Elizabeth	82	" My dear Jane , "
49877	49919	49875	49875	Elizabeth	82	" you are too good . Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you . I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . "
49940	49943	49945	49945	Elizabeth	82	" Nay , "
49947	50117	49945	49945	Elizabeth	82	" this is not fair . _ You _ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody . _ I _ only want to think _ you _ perfect , and you set yourself against it . Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good - will . You need not . There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . The more I see of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . I have met with two instances lately : one I will not mention , the other is Charlotte 's marriage . It is unaccountable ! in every view it is unaccountable ! "
50118	50211	49920	49921	Miss Bennet	82	" My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . They will ruin your happiness . You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . Consider Mr. Collins 's respectability , and Charlotte 's prudent , steady character . Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody 's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . "
50212	50375	49945	49945	Elizabeth	82	" To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart . My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man : you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him can not have a proper way of thinking . You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . "
50376	50389	50391	50391	Jane	83	" I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , "
50393	50514	50391	50391	Jane	83	" and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . But enough of this . You alluded to something else . You mentioned _ two _ instances . I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . Women fancy admiration means more than it does . "
50515	50524	49945	49945	Elizabeth	82	" And men take care that they should . "
50525	50557	50391	50391	Jane	83	" If it is designedly done , they can not be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . "
50558	50574	50576	50576	Elizabeth	82	" I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley 's conduct to design , "
50578	50624	50576	50576	Elizabeth	82	" but , without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error and there may be misery . Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people 's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . "
50625	50636	50391	50391	Jane	83	" And do you impute it to either of those ? "
50637	50670	50576	50576	Elizabeth	82	" Yes ; to the last . But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . Stop me , whilst you can . "
50671	50684	50391	50391	Jane	83	" You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ? "
50685	50694	50576	50576	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , in conjunction with his friend . "
50695	50731	50391	50391	Jane	83	" I can not believe it . Why should they try to influence him ? They can only wish his happiness ; and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it . "
50732	50780	50576	50576	Elizabeth	82	" Your first position is false . They may wish many things besides his happiness : they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . "
50781	50794	50796	50796	Jane	83	" Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy , "
50798	50978	50796	50796	Jane	83	" but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother 's . What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . By supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . Do not distress me by the idea . I am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . "
51133	51138	51140	51140	he	75	" So , Lizzy , "
51145	51254	51140	51140	he	75	" your sister is crossed in love , I find . I congratulate her . Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . When is your turn to come ? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane . Now is your time . Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . Let Wickham be your man . He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . "
51255	51280	51363	51364	general unreserve	1167	" Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . We must not all expect Jane 's good fortune . "
51281	51284	51286	51287	Mr. Bennet	75	" True , "
51289	51321	51286	51287	Mr. Bennet	75	" but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . "
51831	51838	51839	51839	she	125	" I do not blame Jane , "
51842	52027	51839	51839	she	125	" for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . But , Lizzy ! Oh , sister ! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins 's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . The Lucases are very artful people , indeed , sister . They are all for what they can get . I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves . "
52087	52100	52102	52102	she	125	" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , "
52104	52165	52102	52102	she	125	" I am sorry it went off . But these things happen so often ! A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and , when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . "
52166	52174	52176	52176	Elizabeth	82	" An excellent consolation in its way , "
52178	52234	52176	52176	Elizabeth	82	" but it will not do for _ us _ . We do not suffer by accident . It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . "
52235	52300	52102	52102	she	125	" But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . It is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour 's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . Pray , how _ violent was _ Mr. Bingley 's love ? "
52301	52383	52176	52176	Elizabeth	82	" I never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance ; and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer . Could there be finer symptoms ? Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "
52384	52484	52102	52102	she	125	" Oh , yes ! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . Poor Jane ! I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . It had better have happened to _ you _ , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . "
52503	52507	52509	52510	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" I hope , "
52512	52575	52509	52510	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . "
52576	52681	52509	52510	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" And _ that _ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? Mr. Darcy may , perhaps , have _ heard _ of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month 's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and , depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . "
52682	52717	52509	52510	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" So much the better . I hope they will not meet at all . But does not Jane correspond with his sister ? _ She _ will not be able to help calling . "
52718	52726	52509	52510	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" She will drop the acquaintance entirely . "
53310	53471	53306	53306	she	125	" You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him , in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . I have nothing to say against _ him _ : he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . But as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you . You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . Your father would depend on _ your _ resolution and good conduct , I am sure . You must not disappoint your father . "
53472	53483	53276	53277	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . "
53484	53498	53306	53306	she	125	" Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . "
53499	53540	53276	53277	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . I will take care of myself , and of Mr. Wickham too . He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . "
53541	53550	53306	53306	she	125	" Elizabeth , you are not serious now . "
53551	53810	53276	53277	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" I beg your pardon . I will try again . At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- I believe it will be better that he should not . I see the imprudence of it . Oh , _ that _ abominable Mr. Darcy ! My father 's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to forfeit it . My father , however , is partial to Mr. Wickham . In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see , every day , that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld , by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow - creatures , if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wiser to resist ? All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . In short , I will do my best . "
53811	53842	53276	53277	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often . At least you should not _ remind _ your mother of inviting him . "
53843	53851	53853	53853	Elizabeth	82	" As I did the other day , "
53860	53949	53853	53853	Elizabeth	82	" very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _ that _ . But do not imagine that he is always here so often . It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . You know my mother 's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now I hope you are satisfied . "
54062	54071	54034	54034	she	85	" _ wished _ they might be happy . "
54133	54146	54131	54131	Charlotte	101	" I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . "
54147	54155	54131	54131	Charlotte	101	" _ That _ you certainly shall . "
54156	54172	54131	54131	Charlotte	101	" And I have another favour to ask . Will you come and see me ? "
54173	54185	54131	54131	Charlotte	101	" We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . "
54186	54208	54131	54131	Charlotte	101	" I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . "
54223	54236	54238	54238	Charlotte	101	" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , "
54240	54269	54238	54238	Charlotte	101	" and I hope you will consent to be of the party . Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . "
54619	54623	54624	54624	she	83	" My aunt , "
54627	54652	54624	54624	she	83	" is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street . "
54669	54678	54680	54680	her	83	" I did not think Caroline in spirits , "
54683	54790	54680	54680	her	83	" but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . I inquired after their brother , of course . He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner : I wish I could see her . My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out . I dare say I shall soon see them here . "
54924	55490	54911	54911	she	83	" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley 's regard for me . But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but , if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was , in every respect , so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming , her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it . I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . I am sure you will be very comfortable there .
55491	55496	55521	55522	the sister	1244	" Yours , etc . "
55835	56036	55832	55832	she	82	on:--"I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . But my feelings are not only cordial towards _ him _ , they are even impartial towards Miss King . I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . There can be no love in all this . My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do . They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain . "
56854	56861	56862	56862	she	125	" But , my dear Elizabeth , "
56865	56884	56862	56862	she	125	" what sort of girl is Miss King ? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . "
56885	56960	56862	56862	she	125	" Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . "
56961	56983	56862	56862	she	125	" If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . "
56984	57004	56862	56862	she	125	" She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . I know no harm of her . "
57005	57026	56862	56862	she	125	" But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather 's death made her mistress of this fortune ? "
57027	57078	56862	56862	she	125	" No -- why should he ? If it were not allowable for him to gain _ my _ affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? "
57079	57096	56862	56862	she	125	" But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event . "
57097	57133	56862	56862	she	125	" A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . If _ she _ does not object to it , why should _ we _ ? "
57134	57161	56862	56862	she	125	" _ Her _ not objecting does not justify _ him _ . It only shows her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling . "
57162	57165	57167	57167	Elizabeth	82	" Well , "
57169	57191	57167	57167	Elizabeth	82	" have it as you choose . _ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish . "
57192	57230	56862	56862	she	125	" No , Lizzy , that is what I do _ not _ choose . I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . "
57231	57317	57167	57167	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . I am sick of them all . Thank heaven ! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him . Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . "
57318	57331	56862	56862	she	125	" Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . "
57370	57383	57385	57386	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , "
57388	57396	57385	57386	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" but perhaps , to the Lakes . "
57419	57426	57427	57427	she	82	" My dear , dear aunt , "
57431	57570	57427	57427	she	82	" what delight ! what felicity ! You give me fresh life and vigour . Adieu to disappointment and spleen . What are men to rocks and mountains ? Oh , what hours of transport we shall spend ! And when we _ do _ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of anything . We _ will _ know where we have gone -- we _ will _ recollect what we have seen . Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . Let _ our _ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . "
58458	58603	58452	58453	Mr. Collins	129	" Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her Ladyship 's carriage is regularly ordered for us . I _ should _ say , one of her Ladyship 's carriages , for she has several . "
58604	58617	58619	58619	Charlotte	101	" Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman , indeed , "
58621	58628	58619	58619	Charlotte	101	" and a most attentive neighbour . "
58629	58659	58452	58453	Mr. Collins	129	" Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . She is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . "
58852	58898	58837	58837	Maria	94	" Oh , my dear Eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! I will not tell you what it is . Make haste , and come down this moment . "
58947	58953	58955	58955	Elizabeth	82	" And is this all ? "
58957	58982	58955	58955	Elizabeth	82	" I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! "
58983	58989	58991	58991	Maria	94	" La ! my dear , "
58999	59049	58991	58991	Maria	94	" it is not Lady Catherine . The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson , who lives with them . The other is Miss De Bourgh . Only look at her . She is quite a little creature . Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! "
59050	59073	58955	58955	Elizabeth	82	" She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind . Why does she not come in ? "
59074	59097	58991	58991	Maria	94	" Oh , Charlotte says she hardly ever does . It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . "
59098	59104	59106	59106	Elizabeth	82	" I like her appearance , "
59113	59139	59106	59106	Elizabeth	82	" She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . She will make him a very proper wife . "
59334	59338	59340	59340	he	129	" I confess , "
59342	59427	59340	59340	he	129	" that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship 's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ? "
59428	59439	59441	59442	Sir William	80	" I am the less surprised at what has happened , "
59444	59482	59441	59442	Sir William	80	" from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . About the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "
59549	59632	59545	59545	he	129	" Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest -- there is no occasion for anything more . Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . "
60860	60878	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" Your father 's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think ? For your sake , "
60883	60926	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh 's family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? "
60927	60931	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" A little . "
60932	60973	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" Oh then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? "
60974	60980	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" One of them does . "
60981	61018	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours . Do you draw ? "
61019	61026	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" No , not at all . "
61027	61034	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" What , none of you ? "
61035	61039	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" Not one . "
61040	61070	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" That is very strange . But I suppose you had no opportunity . Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . "
61071	61085	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" My mother would have no objection , but my father hates London . "
61086	61093	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" Has your governess left you ? "
61094	61101	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" We never had any governess . "
61102	61141	60856	60857	Lady Catherine	86	" No governess ! How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . "
61159	61180	61149	61149	she	82	" Then who taught you ? who attended to you ? Without a governess , you must have been neglected . "
61181	61230	61149	61149	she	82	" Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means . We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . Those who chose to be idle certainly might . "
61231	61417	61149	61149	she	82	" Ay , no doubt : but that is what a governess will prevent ; and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way . I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe 's calling yesterday to thank me ? She finds Miss Pope a treasure . ' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? "
61418	61425	61149	61149	she	82	" Yes , ma'am , all . "
61426	61464	61149	61149	she	82	" All ! What , all five out at once ? Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? "
61465	61574	61149	61149	she	82	" Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . Perhaps _ she _ is full young to be much in company . But really , ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first . And to be kept back on _ such _ a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . "
61575	61580	61582	61583	her Ladyship	3464	" Upon my word , "
61585	61605	61582	61583	her Ladyship	3464	" you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? "
61606	61614	61616	61616	Elizabeth	82	" With three younger sisters grown up , "
61620	61631	61616	61616	Elizabeth	82	" your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . "
61665	61684	61632	61633	Lady Catherine	86	" You can not be more than twenty , I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . "
61685	61695	61714	61715	Lady Catherine	86	" I am not one - and - twenty . "
63126	63153	63094	63094	Charlotte	101	" I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . "
63359	63380	63342	63342	She	82	" My eldest sister has been in town these three months . Have you never happened to see her there ? "
63825	63857	63818	63818	she	3464	" What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? What is it you are talking of ? What are you telling Miss Bennet ? Let me hear what it is . "
63858	63867	63869	63869	he	164	" We were talking of music , madam , "
63880	63985	63818	63818	she	3464	" Of music ! Then pray speak aloud . It is of all subjects my delight . I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient . And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? "
63998	64012	64014	64015	Lady Catherine	86	" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , "
64017	64042	64014	64015	Lady Catherine	86	" and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . "
64043	64050	64051	64051	he	89	" I assure you , madam , "
64054	64068	64051	64051	he	89	" that she does not need such advice . She practises very constantly . "
64069	64199	64200	64201	Mr. Darcy	89	" So much the better . It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice . I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson 's room . She would be in nobody 's way , you know , in that part of the house . "
64329	64396	64306	64306	Elizabeth	82	" You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me . But I will not be alarmed , though your sister _ does _ play so well . There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . "
64397	64407	64408	64408	he	89	" I shall not say that you are mistaken , "
64411	64460	64408	64408	he	89	" because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which , in fact , are not your own . "
64476	64595	64461	64461	Elizabeth	82	" Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . "
64596	64604	64606	64606	he	1496	" I am not afraid of you , "
64610	64623	64625	64626	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , "
64628	64640	64625	64626	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . "
64641	64747	64461	64461	Elizabeth	82	" You shall hear , then -- but prepare for something very dreadful . The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? He danced only four dances ! I am sorry to pain you , but so it was . He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . Mr. Darcy , you can not deny the fact . "
64748	64769	64625	64626	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . "
64770	64802	64461	64461	Elizabeth	82	" True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball - room . Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? My fingers wait your orders . "
64803	64806	64808	64808	Darcy	89	" Perhaps , "
64810	64834	64808	64808	Darcy	89	" I should have judged better had I sought an introduction , but I am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "
64835	64846	64848	64848	Elizabeth	82	" Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? "
64855	64886	64852	64853	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill - qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? "
64887	64894	64896	64896	Fitzwilliam	164	" I can answer your question , "
64898	64915	64896	64896	Fitzwilliam	164	" without applying to him . It is because he will not give himself the trouble . "
64916	64928	64930	64930	Darcy	89	" I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , "
64932	64966	64930	64930	Darcy	89	" of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . I can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . "
64967	64971	64973	64973	Elizabeth	82	" My fingers , "
64975	65058	64973	64973	Elizabeth	82	" do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women 's do . They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of practising . It is not that I do not believe _ my _ fingers as capable as any other woman 's of superior execution . "
65064	65100	65059	65059	Darcy	89	" You are perfectly right . You have employed your time much better . No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting . We neither of us perform to strangers . "
65142	65201	65126	65127	Lady Catherine	86	" Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master . She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne 's . Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . "
65535	65598	65533	65533	she	82	" How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy ! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London ? "
65599	65607	65608	65608	She	82	" Perfectly so , I thank you . "
65627	65647	65608	65608	She	82	" I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? "
65648	65695	65533	65533	she	82	" I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . "
65696	65773	65608	65608	She	82	" If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . But , perhaps , Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . "
65774	65781	65783	65783	Darcy	89	" I should not be surprised , "
65785	65801	65783	65783	Darcy	89	" if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers . "
65848	65876	65839	65839	He	89	" This seems a very comfortable house . Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford . "
65877	65900	65839	65839	He	89	" I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "
65901	65914	65839	65839	He	89	" Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . "
65915	66003	65839	65839	He	89	" Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . My friend has an excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . She seems perfectly happy , however ; and , in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . "
66004	66027	65839	65839	He	89	" It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . "
66028	66043	65839	65839	He	89	" An easy distance do you call it ? It is nearly fifty miles . "
66044	66073	65839	65839	He	89	" And what is fifty miles of good road ? Little more than half a day 's journey . Yes , I call it a very easy distance . "
66074	66093	66095	66095	Elizabeth	82	" I should never have considered the distance as one of the _ advantages _ of the match , "
66097	66113	66095	66095	Elizabeth	82	" I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _ near _ her family . "
66114	66141	66143	66143	he	1512	" It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . "
66177	66285	66158	66158	he	1512	" I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . Where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . But that is not the case _ here _ . Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _ near _ her family under less than _ half _ the present distance . "
66299	66326	66289	66289	his	89	" _ You _ can not have a right to such very strong local attachment . _ You _ can not have been always at Longbourn . "
66364	66371	66339	66339	he	89	" Are you pleased with Kent ? "
66454	66463	66465	66465	Charlotte	101	" What can be the meaning of this ? "
66474	66500	66465	66465	Charlotte	101	" My dear Eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . "
67473	67486	67471	67471	she	82	" I did not know before that you ever walked this way . "
67487	67498	67499	67499	he	89	" I have been making the tour of the park , "
67502	67528	67499	67499	he	89	" as I generally do every year , and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage . Are you going much farther ? "
67529	67540	67471	67471	she	82	" No , I should have turned in a moment . "
67555	67564	67566	67566	she	82	" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? "
67568	67596	67471	67471	she	82	" Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again . But I am at his disposal . He arranges the business just as he pleases . "
67597	67642	67471	67471	she	82	" And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy . "
67643	67654	67656	67657	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" He likes to have his own way very well , "
67659	67713	67656	67657	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" But so we all do . It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . I speak feelingly . A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . "
67714	67771	67471	67471	she	82	" In my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for ? "
67772	67819	67656	67657	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" These are home questions -- and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature . But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . Younger sons can not marry where they like . "
67820	67837	67471	67471	she	82	" Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . "
67838	67869	67656	67657	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" Our habits of expense make us too dependent , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . "
67870	67874	67876	67876	Elizabeth	82	" Is this , "
67878	67883	67885	67885	she	82	" meant for me ? "
67902	67937	67894	67894	herself	82	" And pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ? Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "
67971	68040	67967	67967	she	82	" I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present ; and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . "
68041	68044	68046	68047	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" No , "
68049	68073	68046	68047	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" that is an advantage which he must divide with me . I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . "
68074	68130	68132	68132	she	1544	" Are you , indeed ? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make ? Does your charge give you much trouble ? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage ; and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . "
68181	68243	68178	68178	She	1544	" You need not be frightened . I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley . I think I have heard you say that you know them . "
68244	68269	68178	68178	She	1544	" I know them a little . Their brother is a pleasant , gentlemanlike man -- he is a great friend of Darcy 's . "
68270	68274	68276	68276	Elizabeth	82	" Oh yes , "
68277	68297	68178	68178	She	1544	drily--"Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . "
68298	68375	68178	68178	She	1544	" Care of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy _ does _ take care of him in those points where he most wants care . From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . It was all conjecture . "
68376	68383	68178	68178	She	1544	" What is it you mean ? "
68384	68420	68178	68178	She	1544	" It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family it would be an unpleasant thing . "
68421	68431	68178	68178	She	1544	" You may depend upon my not mentioning it . "
68432	68523	68178	68178	She	1544	" And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars ; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . "
68524	68536	68178	68178	She	1544	" Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? "
68537	68551	68178	68178	She	1544	" I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . "
68552	68563	68178	68178	She	1544	" And what arts did he use to separate them ? "
68564	68576	68578	68578	Fitzwilliam	89	" He did not talk to me of his own arts , "
68582	68594	68578	68578	Fitzwilliam	89	" He only told me what I have now told you . "
68625	68637	68639	68639	she	82	" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , "
68641	68660	68639	68639	she	82	" Your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings . Why was he to be the judge ? "
68661	68672	68616	68616	Fitzwilliam	89	" You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? "
68673	68721	68722	68722	she	82	" I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination ; or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . But , "
68728	68760	68722	68722	she	82	" as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "
68761	68769	68771	68771	Fitzwilliam	89	" That is not an unnatural surmise , "
68773	68788	68771	68771	Fitzwilliam	89	" but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . "
69018	69029	69031	69032	Colonel Fitzwilliam	164	" There were some very strong objections against the lady , "
69062	69067	69068	69068	she	82	" To Jane herself , "
69071	69134	69068	69068	she	82	" there could be no possibility of objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is ! Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . Neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . "
69777	69811	69765	69765	he	89	" In vain have I struggled . It will not do . My feelings will not be repressed . You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . "
70116	70248	70114	70114	she	82	" In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could _ feel _ gratitude , I would now thank you . But I cannot -- I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . The feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "
70344	70393	70342	70342	he	89	" And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _ endeavour _ at civility , I am thus rejected . But it is of small importance . "
70394	70401	70403	70403	she	82	" I might as well inquire , "
70405	70522	70403	70403	she	82	" why , with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I _ was _ uncivil ? But I have other provocations . You know I have . Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? "
70551	70641	70642	70642	She	82	" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _ there _ . You dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . "
70681	70691	70692	70692	she	82	" Can you deny that you have done it ? "
70702	70744	70698	70698	he	89	" I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . Towards _ him _ I have been kinder than towards myself . "
70770	70779	70780	70780	she	82	" But it is not merely this affair , "
70783	70856	70780	70780	she	82	" on which my dislike is founded . Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . On this subject , what can you have to say ? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ? "
70857	70869	70871	70871	Darcy	89	" You take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , "
70885	70902	70780	70780	she	82	" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him ? "
70903	70907	70909	70909	Darcy	89	" His misfortunes ! "
70911	70920	70909	70909	Darcy	89	contemptuously,--"yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . "
70921	70927	70929	70929	Elizabeth	82	" And of your infliction , "
70934	71008	70929	70929	Elizabeth	82	" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty -- comparative poverty . You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him . You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . You have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . "
71009	71013	71015	71015	Darcy	89	" And this , "
71027	71069	71071	71071	he	89	" is your opinion of me ! This is the estimation in which you hold me ! I thank you for explaining it so fully . My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! But , perhaps , "
71083	71213	71071	71071	he	89	" these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I , with greater policy , concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by everything . But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just . Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? "
71236	71284	71234	71234	she	82	" You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . "
71300	71325	71298	71298	she	82	" You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . "
71349	71447	71346	71346	She	82	" From the very beginning , from the first moment , I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . "
71448	71500	71505	71505	he	1576	" You have said quite enough , madam . I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . "
72094	72123	72081	72081	she	82	" I have been walking in the grove some time , in the hope of meeting you . Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? "
72225	72362	72203	72203	she	82	" Be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you . I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .
72363	75180	72203	72203	she	82	" Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham . Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed , and further apology would be absurd . I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas 's accidental information , that Bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . From that moment I observed my friend 's behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard ; and I remained convinced , from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . If _ you _ have not been mistaken here , _ I _ must have been in an error . Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain ; but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother 's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend you . But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say , farther , that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning . The part which I acted is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own : our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went -- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice . I described and enforced them earnestly . But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance , which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference . He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal , regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point . To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I can not blame myself for having done thus much . There is but one part of my conduct , in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town . I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence is , perhaps , probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me . It is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . If I have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . Of what he has _ particularly _ accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on George Wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge ; most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education . My father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging , he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . The vicious propensities , the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr. Darcy could not have . Here again I shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . It adds even another motive . My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant . There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . His own father did not long survive mine ; and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . I rather wished than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . The business was therefore soon settled . He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . All connection between us seemed now dissolved . I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . In town , I believe , he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence ; and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions . You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself . After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropped . How he lived , I know not . But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr. Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement . She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement ; and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . Regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge . Mr. Wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement . His revenge would have been complete indeed . This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham . I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood , he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at , ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either . Detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . For the truth of everything here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . If your abhorrence of _ me _ should make _ my _ assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . I will only add , God bless you .

How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind . But vanity , not love , has been my folly . Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away where either were concerned .

The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely -- more , I think , than last year . His attachment to Rosings certainly increases . "
77839	77877	77837	77837	she	86	" But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . "
77878	77891	77893	77893	Elizabeth	82	" I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation , "
77895	77915	77893	77893	Elizabeth	82	" but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . "
77916	77970	77837	77837	she	86	" Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . I expected you to stay two months . I told Mrs. Collins so before you came . There can be no occasion for your going so soon . Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . "
77971	77987	77893	77893	Elizabeth	82	" But my father can not . He wrote last week to hurry my return . "
77988	78110	77837	77837	she	86	" Oh , your father , of course , may spare you , if your mother can . Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . And if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and , indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . "
78111	78130	77893	77893	Elizabeth	82	" You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . "
78136	78314	78131	78132	Lady Catherine	86	" Mrs. Collins , you must send a servant with them . You know I always speak my mind , and I can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . It is highly improper . You must contrive to send somebody . I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men - servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs. Collins . I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _ you _ to let them go alone . "
78315	78326	78385	78386	Lady Catherine	86	" My uncle is to send a servant for us . "
78327	78384	78131	78132	Lady Catherine	86	" Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man - servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . Where shall you change horses ? Oh , Bromley , of course . If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to . "
79125	79133	79135	79135	he	129	" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , "
79137	79264	79135	79135	he	129	" whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly . "
79322	79481	79310	79311	Mr. Collins	129	" It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine 's family is , indeed , the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth , I must acknowledge , that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . "
79516	79664	79493	79493	he	1657	" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . I flatter myself , at least , that you will be able to do so . Lady Catherine 's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . We seem to have been designed for each other . "
79929	79932	79933	79933	he	129	" But , "
79936	79966	79933	79933	he	129	" you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . "
79987	79991	79993	79993	Maria	94	" Good gracious ! "
80002	80023	79993	79993	Maria	94	" it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! "
80024	80030	80032	80033	her companion	1675	" A great many indeed , "
80039	80062	79993	79993	Maria	94	" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! "
80067	80077	80063	80063	Elizabeth	82	" And how much I shall have to conceal ! "
80424	80437	80404	80404	they	1688	" Is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? "
80438	80447	80449	80449	Lydia	84	" And we mean to treat you all , "
80451	80472	80449	80449	Lydia	84	" but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . "
80476	80530	80540	80540	she	84	purchases,--"Look here , I have bought this bonnet . I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . "
80547	80614	80540	80540	she	84	" Oh , but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ----shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . "
80615	80621	80623	80623	Elizabeth	82	" Are they , indeed ? "
80630	80697	80540	80540	she	84	" They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all . Mamma would like to go , too , of all things ! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! "
80698	80701	80703	80703	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , "
80705	80758	80703	80703	Elizabeth	82	" _ that _ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . Good Heaven ! Brighton and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton ! "
80759	80769	80771	80771	Lydia	84	" Now I have got some news for you , "
80780	80804	80771	80771	Lydia	84	" What do you think ? It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . "
80829	80953	80824	80824	Lydia	84	" Ay , that is just like your formality and discretion . You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say . But he is an ugly fellow ! I am glad he is gone . I never saw such a long chin in my life . Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? There is no danger of Wickham 's marrying Mary King -- there 's for you ! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ; gone to stay . Wickham is safe . "
80954	80961	80963	80963	Elizabeth	82	" And Mary King is safe ! "
80965	80975	80963	80963	Elizabeth	82	" safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . "
80976	80991	80824	80824	Lydia	84	" She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . "
80992	81005	81007	81007	Jane	83	" But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , "
81009	81047	80824	80824	Lydia	84	" I am sure there is not on _ his _ . I will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her . Who _ could _ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? "
81142	81150	81152	81152	Lydia	84	" How nicely we are crammed in ! "
81154	81583	81152	81152	Lydia	84	" I am glad I brought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another band - box ! Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away . Have you seen any pleasant men ? Have you had any flirting ? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . She is almost three - and - twenty ! Lord ! how ashamed I should be of not being married before three - and - twenty ! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands you ca n't think . She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but _ I _ do not think there would have been any fun in it . Lord ! how I should like to be married before any of you ! and then I would _ chaperon _ you about to all the balls . Dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster 's ! Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by - the - bye , Mrs. Forster and me are _ such _ friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come : but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman 's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun ! Not a soul knew of it , but Colonel and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked ! When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . Lord ! how I laughed ! and so did Mrs. Forster . I thought I should have died . And _ that _ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . "
81669	81680	81681	81681	Their	1700	" I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . "
81804	81809	81811	81811	she	85	" Oh , Mary , "
81813	81970	81811	81811	she	85	" I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . And then when we came away it was such fun ! I thought we never should have got into the coach . I was ready to die of laughter . And then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off ! "
81979	82027	81974	81974	Mary	87	" Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . But I confess they would have no charms for _ me _ . I should infinitely prefer a book . "
82399	82409	82411	82411	she	82	" His being so sure of succeeding was wrong , "
82413	82432	82411	82411	she	82	" and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . "
82433	82436	82438	82438	Elizabeth	82	" Indeed , "
82440	82476	82438	82438	Elizabeth	82	" I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? "
82477	82485	82411	82411	she	82	" Blame you ! Oh , no . "
82486	82499	82438	82438	Elizabeth	82	" But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham ? "
82500	82517	82411	82411	she	82	" No -- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . "
82518	82539	82438	82438	Elizabeth	82	" But you _ will _ know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . "
82642	82648	82650	82650	Elizabeth	82	" This will not do , "
82652	82735	82650	82650	Elizabeth	82	" you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy 's , but you shall do as you choose . "
82752	82764	82766	82766	she	83	" I do not know when I have been more shocked , "
82768	82836	82766	82766	she	83	" Wickham so very bad ! It is almost past belief . And poor Mr. Darcy ! dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . Such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! It is really too distressing , I am sure you must feel it so . "
82837	82903	82622	82622	she	83	" Oh no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . Your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . "
82904	82928	82766	82766	she	83	" Poor Wickham ! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner . "
82929	82961	82622	82622	she	83	" There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . "
82962	82983	82766	82766	she	83	" I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _ appearance _ of it as you used to do . "
82984	83059	82622	82622	she	83	" And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . It is such a spur to one 's genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind . One may be continually abusive without saying anything just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . "
83060	83084	82766	82766	she	83	" Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . "
83085	83155	82622	82622	she	83	" Indeed , I could not . I was uncomfortable enough , I was very uncomfortable -- I may say unhappy . And with no one to speak to of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me , and say that I had not been so very weak , and vain , and nonsensical , as I knew I had ! Oh , how I wanted you ! "
83156	83186	82766	82766	she	83	" How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy , for now they _ do _ appear wholly undeserved . "
83187	83245	82622	82622	she	83	" Certainly . But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . There is one point on which I want your advice . I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham 's character . "
83256	83275	83246	83247	Miss Bennet	82	" Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . What is your own opinion ? "
83276	83435	82766	82766	she	83	" That it ought not to be attempted . Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public . On the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . I am not equal to it . Wickham will soon be gone ; and , therefore , it will not signify to anybody here what he really is . Some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . At present I will say nothing about it . "
83436	83483	83246	83247	Miss Bennet	82	" You are quite right . To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . We must not make him desperate . "
83613	83617	83619	83619	she	82	" And then , "
83621	83667	83619	83619	she	82	" if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . The liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! "
83796	83801	83803	83804	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Well , Lizzy , "
83809	83925	83803	83804	Mrs. Bennet	85	" what is your opinion _ now _ of this sad business of Jane 's ? For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . I told my sister Philips so the other day . But I can not find out that Jane saw anything of him in London . Well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . "
83926	83941	84042	84043	her mother	241	" I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . "
83942	84018	83803	83804	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Oh , well ! it is just as he chooses . Nobody wants him to come ; though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and , if I was her , I would not have put up with it . Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "
84035	84040	84042	84043	her mother	241	" Well , Lizzy , "
84048	84119	84042	84043	her mother	241	" and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? Well , well , I only hope it will last . And what sort of table do they keep ? Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say . If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . There is nothing extravagant in _ their _ housekeeping , I dare say . "
84120	84127	84042	84043	her mother	241	" No , nothing at all . "
84128	84210	84042	84043	her mother	241	" A great deal of good management , depend upon it . Yes , yes . _ They _ will take care not to outrun their income . _ They _ will never be distressed for money . Well , much good may it do them ! And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . "
84211	84224	84042	84043	her mother	241	" It was a subject which they could not mention before me . "
84225	84288	84042	84043	her mother	241	" No ; it would have been strange if they had . But I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves . Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . _ I _ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . "
84393	84410	84412	84412	they	1739	" Good Heaven ! What is to become of us ? What are we to do ? "
84421	84431	84412	84412	they	1739	" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? "
84459	84464	84466	84466	she	1745	" I am sure , "
84468	84492	84466	84466	she	1745	" I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller 's regiment went away . I thought I should have broke my heart . "
84493	84504	84506	84506	Lydia	84	" I am sure I shall break _ mine _ , "
84508	84517	84519	84520	Mrs. Bennet	85	" If one could but go to Brighton ! "
84522	84538	84466	84466	she	1745	" Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton ! But papa is so disagreeable . "
84539	84552	84466	84466	she	1745	" A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . "
84553	84572	84574	84574	Kitty	86	" And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _ me _ a great deal of good , "
84810	84829	84831	84831	she	86	" I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , "
84833	84868	84831	84831	she	86	" though I am _ not _ her particular friend . I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . "
85021	85063	85013	85013	He	244	" Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . "
85064	85070	85072	85072	Elizabeth	82	" If you were aware , "
85074	85119	85072	85072	Elizabeth	82	" of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner , nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . "
85120	85124	85126	85127	Mr. Bennet	75	" Already arisen ! "
85129	85193	85126	85127	Mr. Bennet	75	" What ! has she frightened away some of your lovers ? Poor little Lizzy ! But do not be cast down . Such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia 's folly . "
85194	85450	85451	85452	Mr. Bennet	75	" Indeed , you are mistaken . I have no such injuries to resent . It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining . Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia 's character . Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly . If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . Her character will be fixed ; and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . She will follow wherever Lydia leads . Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! Oh , my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? "
85474	85648	85451	85452	Mr. Bennet	75	" Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may say , three -- very silly sisters . We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . Let her go , then . Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . The officers will find women better worth their notice . Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . "
86305	86317	86300	86300	he	136	" How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? "
86318	86323	86300	86300	he	136	" Nearly three weeks . "
86324	86331	86300	86300	he	136	" And you saw him frequently ? "
86332	86339	86300	86300	he	136	" Yes , almost every day . "
86340	86351	86300	86300	he	136	" His manners are very different from his cousin 's . "
86352	86367	86300	86300	he	136	" Yes , very different ; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance . "
86368	86371	86373	86373	Wickham	136	" Indeed ! "
86384	86390	86395	86395	he	136	" And pray may I ask-- "
86403	86431	86432	86432	he	136	" Is it in address that he improves ? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style ? for I dare not hope , "
86443	86451	86432	86432	he	136	" that he is improved in essentials . "
86452	86457	86459	86459	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , no ! "
86461	86477	86459	86459	Elizabeth	82	" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . "
86521	86562	86519	86519	she	82	" When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement ; but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "
86604	86766	86591	86591	he	136	" You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . "
87643	87649	87651	87651	she	82	" But it is fortunate , "
87653	87734	87651	87651	she	82	" that I have something to wish for . Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister 's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized . A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . "
88327	88331	88333	88333	she	82	" But surely , "
88335	88358	88333	88333	she	82	" I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars , without his perceiving me . "
88714	88734	88736	88737	her aunt	1198	" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? "
88739	88765	88736	88737	her aunt	1198	" A place , too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . "
88826	88837	88839	88839	she	125	" If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , "
88841	88867	88839	88839	she	125	" I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . They have some of the finest woods in the country . "
89643	89649	89651	89651	she	82	" And of this place , "
89653	89704	89706	89706	herself	82	" I might have been mistress ! With these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted ! Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But , no , "
89708	89735	89706	89706	herself	82	" that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; I should not have been allowed to invite them . "
89802	89818	89792	89793	Mrs. Reynolds	183	" But we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . "
89922	89931	89932	89932	she	816	" He is now gone into the army , "
89935	89947	89932	89932	she	816	" but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . "
89965	89969	89971	89972	Mrs. Reynolds	183	" And that , "
89981	90007	89971	89972	Mrs. Reynolds	183	" is my master -- and very like him . It was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago . "
90008	90020	90022	90023	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" I have heard much of your master 's fine person , "
90030	90052	90022	90023	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" it is a handsome face . But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . "
90071	90080	90053	90054	Mrs. Reynolds	183	" Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy ? "
90087	90091	90081	90081	Elizabeth	82	" A little . "
90092	90106	90053	90054	Mrs. Reynolds	183	" And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ? "
90107	90113	90081	90081	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , very handsome . "
90114	90173	90053	90054	Mrs. Reynolds	183	" I am sure _ I _ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . This room was my late master 's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . He was very fond of them . "
90207	90218	90220	90221	Mr. Gardiner	153	" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? "
90223	90278	90279	90280	Mr. Gardiner	153	" Oh , yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished ! She plays and sings all day long . In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master : she comes here to - morrow with him . "
90320	90334	90279	90280	Mr. Gardiner	153	" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? "
90335	90369	90279	90280	Mr. Gardiner	153	" Not so much as I could wish , sir : but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . "
90370	90373	90375	90375	Elizabeth	82	" Except , "
90377	90384	90375	90375	Elizabeth	82	" when she goes to Ramsgate . "
90385	90399	90279	90280	Mr. Gardiner	153	" If your master would marry , you might see more of him . "
90400	90428	90375	90375	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , sir ; but I do not know when _ that _ will be . I do not know who is good enough for him . "
90441	90460	90435	90435	Elizabeth	82	" It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . "
90461	90479	90481	90482	the other	590	" I say no more than the truth , and what everybody will say that knows him , "
90503	90530	90499	90500	the housekeeper	816	" I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . "
90581	90604	90577	90578	her uncle	573	" There are very few people of whom so much can be said . You are lucky in having such a master . "
90605	90674	90675	90675	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , sir , I know I am . If I were to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world . "
90681	90688	90690	90690	she	82	" Can this be Mr. Darcy ? "
90692	90700	90702	90703	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" His father was an excellent man , "
90705	90731	90675	90675	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor . "
90827	90839	90841	90841	she	82	" He is the best landlord , and the best master , "
90843	90920	90841	90841	she	82	" that ever lived . Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw anything of it . To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . "
90921	90932	90934	90934	Elizabeth	82	" In what an amiable light does this place him ! "
90936	90943	90945	90946	her aunt	1198	" This fine account of him , "
90951	90964	90945	90946	her aunt	1198	" is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "
90965	90972	90945	90946	her aunt	1198	" Perhaps we might be deceived . "
90973	90986	90945	90946	her aunt	1198	" That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . "
91048	91056	91058	91058	Elizabeth	82	" He is certainly a good brother , "
91084	91094	91095	91095	she	183	" And this is always the way with him , "
91098	91126	91095	91095	she	183	" Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . There is nothing he would not do for her . "
92979	92982	92958	92958	she	82	" delightful , "
92984	92987	92958	92958	she	82	" charming , "
93095	93102	93104	93104	she	82	" What will be his surprise , "
93106	93123	93104	93104	she	82	" when he knows who they are ! He takes them now for people of fashion . "
93402	93463	93399	93399	she	82	" Why is he so altered ? From what can it proceed ? It can not be for _ me _ , it can not be for _ my _ sake that his manners are thus softened . My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . It is impossible that he should still love me . "
93603	93607	93608	93608	she	584	unexpected--"for your housekeeper , "
93611	93647	93608	93608	she	584	" informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and , indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . "
93684	93694	93695	93695	he	255	" They will join me early to - morrow , "
93698	93717	93695	93695	he	255	" and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr . Bingley and his sisters . "
93766	93777	93778	93778	he	255	" There is also one other person in the party , "
93784	93820	93778	93778	he	255	" who more particularly wishes to be known to you . Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? "
94165	94178	94180	94181	her uncle	573	" He is perfectly well - behaved , polite , and unassuming , "
94183	94199	94201	94202	her aunt	1198	" There _ is _ something a little stately in him , to be sure , "
94204	94244	94201	94202	her aunt	1198	" but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _ I _ have seen nothing of it . "
94245	94286	94201	94202	her aunt	1198	" I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . "
94287	94294	94296	94297	her aunt	1198	" To be sure , Lizzy , "
94299	94337	94296	94297	her aunt	1198	" he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham 's countenance , for his features are perfectly good . But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? "
94375	94388	94390	94391	her uncle	573	" But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , "
94393	94429	94390	94391	her uncle	573	" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . "
94444	94453	94455	94456	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" From what we have seen of him , "
94458	94587	94455	94456	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham . He has not an ill - natured look . On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . But , to be sure , the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character ! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and _ that _ , in the eye of a servant , comprehends every virtue . "
95939	95955	95963	95963	he	79	" was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; "
95966	95992	95963	95963	he	79	" It is above eight months . We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . "
98462	98489	98437	98438	Miss Bingley	91	" Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton ? They must be a great loss to _ your _ family . "
98995	99008	99009	99009	she	91	" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , "
99012	99052	99009	99009	she	91	" I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . She is grown so brown and coarse ! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . "
99090	99096	99097	99097	she	91	" For my own part , "
99100	99219	99097	99097	she	91	" I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them . They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . "
99285	99367	99283	99283	she	91	" I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' _ She _ a beauty ! I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . "
99368	99371	99373	99373	Darcy	89	" Yes , "
99382	99415	99373	99373	Darcy	89	" but _ that _ was only when I first knew her ; for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . "
99740	100067	100079	100079	she	2210	" Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . "
100120	100899	100070	100070	herself	2210	" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I can not answer for being coherent . Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . Though Lydia 's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from B. , intending to trace their route . He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney - coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . I know not what to think . After making every possible inquiry on that side London , Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success,--no such people had been seen to pass through . With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. ; but no one can throw any blame on them . Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . My father and mother believe the worst , but I can not think so ill of him . Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia 's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to everything ? Impossible ! I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage : he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted . My poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room . Could she exert herself , it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one can not wonder . I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . Adieu ! I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not ; but circumstances are such , that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening . In such an exigence my uncle 's advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . "
100900	100910	100912	100912	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? "
100996	101031	100979	100979	she	82	" I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . "
101032	101041	101043	101043	he	2211	" Good God ! what is the matter ? "
101055	101092	101043	101043	he	2211	" I will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . You are not well enough ; you can not go yourself . "
101195	101230	101176	101176	Darcy	89	" Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . "
101231	101238	101239	101239	she	82	" No , I thank you , "
101247	101277	101239	101239	she	82	" There is nothing the matter with me . I am quite well , I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . "
101327	101415	101323	101323	she	82	" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . It can not be concealed from anyone . My youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham . They are gone off together from Brighton . _ You _ know him too well to doubt the rest . She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . "
101422	101427	101428	101428	she	82	" When I consider , "
101438	101501	101428	101428	she	82	" that _ I _ might have prevented it ! _ I _ who knew what he was . Had I but explained some part of it only -- some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! Had his character been known , this could not have happened . But it is all , all too late now . "
101502	101509	101511	101511	Darcy	89	" I am grieved , indeed , "
101513	101526	101511	101511	Darcy	89	" grieved -- shocked . But is it certain , absolutely certain ? "
101527	101559	101428	101428	she	82	" Oh , yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond : they are certainly not gone to Scotland . "
101560	101576	101511	101511	Darcy	89	" And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? "
101577	101658	101428	101428	she	82	" My father has gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle 's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . How is such a man to be worked on ? How are they even to be discovered ? I have not the smallest hope . It is every way horrible ! "
101667	101713	101428	101428	she	82	" When _ my _ eyes were opened to his real character , oh ! had I known what I ought , what I dared to do ! But I knew not -- I was afraid of doing too much . Wretched , wretched mistake ! "
101943	102041	101923	101924	her companion	1675	" I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern . Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress ! But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister 's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . "
102042	102087	102088	102088	He	2223	" Oh , yes ! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy . Say that urgent business calls us home immediately . Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible . I know it can not be long . "
102865	102875	102877	102878	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? "
102880	102896	102877	102878	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so ? "
102897	102921	102877	102878	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . _ That _ is all settled . "
102922	102928	102930	102931	the other	590	" What is all settled ? "
102942	102967	102934	102934	she	590	" And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ? Oh , that I knew how it was ! "
103131	103142	103144	103145	her uncle	573	" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , "
103154	103269	103144	103145	her uncle	573	" and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his Colonel 's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? His temptation is not adequate to the risk . "
103270	103277	103279	103279	Elizabeth	82	" Do you really think so ? "
103287	103292	103294	103295	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" Upon my word , "
103297	103362	103294	103295	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" I begin to be of your uncle 's opinion . It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . I can not think so very ill of Wickham . Can you , yourself , Lizzie , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? "
103363	103415	103144	103145	her uncle	573	" Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . If , indeed , it should be so ! But I dare not hope it . Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? "
103416	103422	103424	103425	Mr. Gardiner	153	" In the first place , "
103427	103441	103424	103425	Mr. Gardiner	153	" there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . "
103442	103477	103144	103145	her uncle	573	" Oh , but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption ! And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . "
103478	103544	103424	103425	Mr. Gardiner	153	" Well , then,--supposing them to be in London -- they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . "
103545	103774	103144	103145	her uncle	573	" But why all this secrecy ? Why any fear of detection ? Why must their marriage be private ? Oh , no , no -- this is not likely . His most particular friend , you see by Jane 's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . He can not afford it . And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . "
103775	103806	103424	103425	Mr. Gardiner	153	" But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? "
103807	103820	103822	103822	Elizabeth	82	" It does seem , and it is most shocking , indeed , "
103830	104017	103822	103822	Elizabeth	82	" that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young : she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power , by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . "
104018	104025	104027	104028	her aunt	1198	" But you see that Jane , "
104030	104048	104027	104028	her aunt	1198	" does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . "
104049	104137	103822	103822	Elizabeth	82	" Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . "
104138	104147	104149	104150	Mrs. Gardiner	125	" And do you really know all this ? "
104165	104171	104173	104173	Elizabeth	82	" I do , indeed , "
104177	104300	104173	104173	Elizabeth	82	" I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless . From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . Yet he knew to the contrary himself . He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "
104301	104325	103822	103822	Elizabeth	82	" But does Lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? "
104326	104509	104173	104173	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , yes!--that , that is the worst of all . Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . And when I returned home the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight 's time . As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone , that the good opinion , which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . That _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . That such a consequence as _ this _ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . "
104510	104536	103822	103822	Elizabeth	82	" When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? "
104537	104671	104173	104173	Elizabeth	82	" Not the slightest . I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months : but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . "
104931	104935	104937	104937	Jane	83	" Not yet , "
104939	104956	104937	104937	Jane	83	" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . "
104957	104964	104903	104903	she	82	" Is my father in town ? "
104965	104979	104937	104937	Jane	83	" Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . "
104980	104989	104903	104903	she	82	" And have you heard from him often ? "
104990	105050	104937	104937	Jane	83	" We have heard only once . He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . "
105051	105065	104903	104903	she	82	" And my mother -- how is she ? How are you all ? "
105066	105118	104937	104937	Jane	83	" My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . She is upstairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . She does not yet leave her dressing - room . Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well . "
105119	105127	105129	105129	Elizabeth	82	" But you -- how are you ? "
105131	105144	105129	105129	Elizabeth	82	" You look pale . How much you must have gone through ! "
105383	105390	105392	105392	she	85	" If I had been able , "
105394	105581	105392	105392	she	85	" to carry my point in going to Brighton with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened : but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am . Poor , dear child ! And now here 's Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . "
105633	105642	105644	105644	he	153	" Do not give way to useless alarm , "
105646	105762	105644	105644	he	153	" though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . In a few days more , we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . "
105763	105770	105772	105773	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Oh , my dear brother , "
105775	105974	105772	105773	Mrs. Bennet	85	" that is exactly what I could most wish for . And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry . And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . And , above all things , keep Mr. Bennet from fighting . Tell him what a dreadful state I am in -- that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at my heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will contrive it all . "
106255	106295	106305	106305	she	87	" This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . "
106308	106377	106305	106305	she	87	" Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable , that one false step involves her in endless ruin , that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . "
106496	106544	106488	106489	the former	327	" But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard . Give me further particulars . What did Colonel Forster say ? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ? They must have seen them together for ever . "
106545	106631	106488	106489	the former	327	" Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia 's side , but nothing to give him any alarm . I am so grieved for him . His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . He _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "
106632	106660	106488	106489	the former	327	" And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? Did he know of their intending to go off ? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? "
106661	106718	106488	106489	the former	327	" Yes ; but when questioned by _ him _ , Denny denied knowing anything of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying , and from _ that _ I am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before . "
106719	106744	106488	106489	the former	327	" And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? "
106745	106862	106488	106489	the former	327	" How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ? I felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister 's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . My father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia 's last letter she had prepared her for such a step . She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other many weeks . "
106863	106872	106488	106489	the former	327	" But not before they went to Brighton ? "
106873	106880	106488	106489	the former	327	" No , I believe not . "
106881	106901	106488	106489	the former	327	" And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? Does he know his real character ? "
106902	106957	106488	106489	the former	327	" I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant ; and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt : but I hope this may be false . "
106958	106984	106488	106489	the former	327	" Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! "
106985	106993	106995	106996	her sister	328	" Perhaps it would have been better , "
106998	107020	106488	106489	the former	327	" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . "
107021	107029	106488	106489	the former	327	" We acted with the best intentions . "
107030	107045	106488	106489	the former	327	" Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia 's note to his wife ? "
107046	107057	106488	106489	the former	327	" He brought it with him for us to see . "
107081	107087	106488	106489	the former	327	" My dear Harriet , * /
107088	107341	106488	106489	the former	327	" You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I can not help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . I am going to Gretna Green , and if you can not guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . What a good joke it will be ! I can hardly write for laughing . Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night . Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure . I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up . Good - bye . Give my love to Colonel Forster . I hope you will drink to our good journey .
107342	107346	106488	106489	the former	327	" Your affectionate friend ,
107347	107351	106488	106489	the former	327	" LYDIA BENNET . "
107352	107360	107362	107362	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! "
107369	107434	107362	107362	Elizabeth	82	" What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment ! But at least it shows that _ she _ was serious in the object of her journey . Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy . My poor father ! how he must have felt it ! "
107435	107469	106488	106489	the former	327	" I never saw anyone so shocked . He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "
107470	107475	107477	107477	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , Jane , "
107479	107501	107477	107477	Elizabeth	82	" was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "
107502	107574	106488	106489	the former	327	" I do not know : I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult . My mother was in hysterics ; and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done . But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . "
107575	107612	106488	106489	the former	327	" Your attendance upon her has been too much for you . You do not look well . Oh that I had been with you ! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "
107613	107746	106488	106489	the former	327	" Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . She was of great use and comfort to us all , and Lady Lucas has been very kind : she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . "
107747	107756	107758	107758	Elizabeth	82	" She had better have stayed at home , "
107760	107809	107758	107758	Elizabeth	82	" perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one 's neighbours . Assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable . Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "
107837	107844	107846	107846	Jane	83	" He meant , I believe , "
107848	108021	107846	107846	Jane	83	" to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if anything could be made out from them . His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady 's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked , he meant to make inquiries at Clapham . If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . I do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . "
108642	108776	108611	108611	He	153	" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . If there were anyone that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person . "
109026	109032	109000	109000	Elizabeth	82	" My dear Sir , * /
109033	109209	109000	109000	Elizabeth	82	" I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be , of all others , most afflicting to a parent 's mind . The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your
109435	109442	109448	109449	Mr. Gardiner	153	" I am , dear sir , "
109669	109673	109674	109674	she	83	" A gamester ! "
109677	109691	109674	109674	she	83	" This is wholly unexpected ; I had not an idea of it . "
109799	109812	109813	109813	she	85	" What ! is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ? "
109816	109846	109813	109813	she	85	" Sure he will not leave London before he has found them . Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "
110169	110195	110166	110166	he	75	" Say nothing of that . Who should suffer but myself ? It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . "
110196	110206	110208	110208	Elizabeth	82	" You must not be too severe upon yourself , "
110210	110268	110157	110157	her	82	" You may well warn me against such an evil . Human nature is so prone to fall into it ! No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . It will pass away soon enough . "
110269	110279	110342	110342	he	244	" Do you suppose them to be in London ? "
110280	110292	110157	110157	her	82	" Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? "
110293	110304	110306	110306	Kitty	86	" And Lydia used to want to go to London , "
110308	110315	110317	110318	her father	244	" She is happy , then , "
110322	110334	110317	110318	her father	244	" and her residence there will probably be of some duration . "
110345	110378	110342	110342	he	244	" Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind . "
110395	110401	110403	110403	he	244	" This is a parade , "
110405	110459	110403	110403	he	244	" which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away . "
110460	110471	110473	110473	Kitty	86	" I am not going to run away , papa , "
110477	110495	110473	110473	Kitty	86	" If _ I _ should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . "
110496	110603	110403	110403	he	244	" _ You _ go to Brighton ! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne , for fifty pounds ! No , Kitty , I have at least learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "
110620	110625	110627	110627	he	2379	" Well , well , "
110629	110661	110627	110627	he	2379	" do not make yourself unhappy . If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . "
110730	110767	110724	110724	she	816	" I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . "
110768	110783	110724	110724	she	816	" What do you mean , Hill ? We have heard nothing from town . "
110784	110788	110790	110791	Mrs. Hill	128	" Dear madam , "
110797	110828	110790	110791	Mrs. Hill	128	" do n't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner ? He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . "
110890	110909	110885	110886	the butler	2390	" If you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse . "
110989	111007	110973	110974	her sister	328	" Oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? "
111008	111021	111074	111074	his	247	" Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . "
111022	111036	110973	110974	her sister	328	" Well , and what news does it bring -- good or bad ? "
111037	111047	111049	111049	he	247	" What is there of good to be expected ? "
111058	111068	111049	111049	he	247	" but perhaps you would like to read it . "
111082	111087	111089	111090	their father	247	" Read it aloud , "
111092	111103	111089	111090	their father	247	" for I hardly know myself what it is about . "
111107	111119	111089	111090	their father	247	" Gracechurch Street , _ Monday , August 2 _ . * /
111120	111124	111089	111090	their father	247	" My dear Brother ,
111125	111200	111089	111090	their father	247	" At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . The particulars I reserve till we meet . It is enough to know they are discovered : I have seen them both---- "
111201	111210	111212	111212	Jane	83	" Then it is as I always hoped , "
111214	111219	111212	111212	Jane	83	" they are married ! "
111224	111588	111220	111220	Elizabeth	82	" I have seen them both . They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . These are conditions which , considering everything , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr. Wickham 's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . She comes to us to - day . I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . Yours , etc .
111589	111594	111677	111677	she	82	" EDW . GARDINER . "
111595	111600	111602	111602	Elizabeth	82	" Is it possible ? "
111609	111620	111605	111605	she	82	" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? "
111621	111636	111638	111639	her sister	328	" Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him , "
111641	111650	111638	111639	her sister	328	" My dear father , I congratulate you . "
111651	111659	111661	111661	Elizabeth	82	" And have you answered the letter ? "
111663	111673	111677	111677	she	82	" No ; but it must be done soon . "
111690	111697	111698	111698	she	82	" Oh ! my dear father , "
111701	111719	111698	111698	she	82	" come back and write immediately . Consider how important every moment is in such a case . "
111720	111727	111729	111729	Jane	83	" Let me write for you , "
111731	111739	111729	111729	Jane	83	" if you dislike the trouble yourself . "
111740	111747	111748	111748	he	2400	" I dislike it very much , "
111751	111758	111748	111748	he	2400	" but it must be done . "
111775	111782	111784	111784	Elizabeth	82	" And -- may I ask ? "
111786	111799	111784	111784	Elizabeth	82	" but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . "
111800	111814	111729	111729	Jane	83	" Complied with ! I am only ashamed of his asking so little . "
111815	111832	111784	111784	Elizabeth	82	" And they _ must _ marry ! Yet he is _ such _ a man . "
111833	111889	111729	111729	Jane	83	" Yes , yes , they must marry . There is nothing else to be done . But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . "
111890	111896	111898	111898	Jane	83	" Money ! my uncle ! "
111900	111908	111898	111898	Jane	83	" what do you mean , sir ? "
111909	111943	111729	111729	Jane	83	" I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . "
111944	111950	111952	111952	Elizabeth	82	" That is very true , "
111954	112008	111952	111952	Elizabeth	82	" though it had not occurred to me before . His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh , it must be my uncle 's doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this . "
112009	112012	112014	112015	her father	244	" No , "
112017	112054	112014	112015	her father	244	" Wickham 's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds : I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "
112055	112073	112014	112015	her father	244	" Ten thousand pounds ! Heaven forbid ! How is half such a sum to be repaid ? "
112117	112126	112128	112128	Elizabeth	82	" And they are really to be married ! "
112138	112185	112128	112128	Elizabeth	82	" How strange this is ! and for _ this _ we are to be thankful . That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! Oh , Lydia ! "
112186	112193	112195	112195	Jane	83	" I comfort myself with thinking , "
112197	112266	112195	112195	Jane	83	" that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . He has children of his own , and may have more . How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "
112267	112282	112284	112284	Elizabeth	82	" If we are ever able to learn what Wickham 's debts have been , "
112286	112402	112284	112284	Elizabeth	82	" and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "
112403	112417	112419	112419	Jane	83	" We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , "
112421	112491	112419	112419	Jane	83	" I hope and trust they will yet be happy . His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . "
112492	112499	112501	112501	Elizabeth	82	" Their conduct has been such , "
112503	112526	112501	112501	Elizabeth	82	" as neither you , nor I , nor anybody , can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it . "
112585	112591	112572	112572	He	247	" Just as you please . "
112592	112605	112572	112572	He	247	" May we take my uncle 's letter to read to her ? "
112606	112616	112572	112572	He	247	" Take whatever you like , and get away . "
112755	112762	112763	112763	she	83	" My dear , dear Lydia ! "
112766	112908	112763	112763	she	83	" this is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage everything . How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . Stay , stay , I will go myself . Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill . I will put on my things in a moment . My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! "
112941	112950	112951	112951	she	2416	" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , "
112954	112978	112951	112951	she	2416	" in a great measure to his kindness . We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . "
112979	112982	112984	112985	her mother	241	" Well , "
112987	113131	112984	112985	her mother	241	" it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents . Well ! I am so happy . In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . Mrs. Wickham ! How well it sounds ! And she was only sixteen last June . My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I ca n't write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me . We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . "
113219	113226	113228	113228	she	2421	" I will go to Meryton , "
113230	113342	113228	113228	she	2421	" as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long . Kitty , run down and order the carriage . An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ? Oh ! here comes Hill . My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . "
114354	114360	114362	114362	she	85	" Haye Park might do , "
114364	114417	114362	114362	she	85	" if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off . I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . "
114443	114501	114438	114438	he	255	" Mrs. Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . Into _ one _ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance . I will not encourage the imprudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . "
115278	115290	115291	115291	he	153	" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , "
115294	115591	115291	115291	he	153	" as soon as his marriage was fixed on . And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's . It is Mr. Wickham 's intention to go into the Regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . He has the promise of an ensigncy in General---- 's regiment , now quartered in the north . It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information ? He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south . She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--Yours , etc .
115592	115596	115623	115624	Mrs. Bennet	85	" E. GARDINER . "
115705	115714	115716	115716	she	84	" She is so fond of Mrs. Forster , "
115718	115758	115716	115716	she	84	" it will be quite shocking to send her away ! And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . The officers may not be so pleasant in General---- 's regiment . "
116528	116537	116538	116538	she	84	" Only think of its being three months , "
116541	116606	116538	116538	she	84	" since I went away : it seems but a fortnight , I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . Good gracious ! when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . "
116643	116730	116625	116625	she	84	" Oh , mamma , do the people hereabouts know I am married to - day ? I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like anything . "
116798	116822	116792	116792	her	84	" Ah , Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . "
116875	116878	116873	116873	herself	84	" Mrs. Wickham "
116909	116914	116916	116916	she	84	" Well , mamma , "
116929	116996	116916	116916	she	84	" and what do you think of my husband ? Is not he a charming man ? I am sure my sisters must all envy me . I only hope they may have half my good luck . They must all go to Brighton . That is the place to get husbands . What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go ! "
116997	117034	117114	117115	her mother	241	" Very true ; and if I had my will we should . But , my dear Lydia , I do n't at all like your going such a way off . Must it be so ? "
117035	117103	116916	116916	she	84	" Oh , Lord ! yes ; there is nothing in that . I shall like it of all things . You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . "
117104	117112	117114	117115	her mother	241	" I should like it beyond anything ! "
117117	117153	116916	116916	she	84	" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . "
117154	117165	117167	117167	Elizabeth	82	" I thank you for my share of the favour , "
117169	117182	117167	117167	Elizabeth	82	" but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "
117480	117527	117476	117476	she	82	" Lizzy , I never gave _ you _ an account of my wedding , I believe . You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? "
117528	117533	117535	117535	Elizabeth	82	" No , really , "
117537	117551	117535	117535	Elizabeth	82	" I think there can not be too little said on the subject . "
117552	117626	117476	117476	she	82	" La ! You are so strange ! But I must tell you how it went off . We were married , you know , at St. Clement 's , because Wickham 's lodgings were in that parish . And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock . My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church .
117627	117733	117535	117535	Elizabeth	82	" Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss ! I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat .
117734	117832	117476	117476	she	82	" Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual : I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . If you 'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . Not one party , or scheme , or anything ! To be sure , London was rather thin , but , however , the Little Theatre was open .
117833	117973	117535	117535	Elizabeth	82	" Well , and so , just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone . And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day . But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ' time , and then we all set out . However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . "
117974	117978	117980	117980	Elizabeth	82	" Mr. Darcy ! "
117986	118041	117535	117535	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , yes ! he was to come there with Wickham , you know . But , gracious me ! I quite forgot ! I ought not to have said a word about it . I promised them so faithfully ! What will Wickham say ? It was to be such a secret ! "
118042	118051	118053	118053	Jane	83	" If it was to be a secret , "
118055	118073	118053	118053	Jane	83	" say not another word on the subject . You may depend upon my seeking no further . "
118074	118079	118081	118081	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , certainly , "
118088	118096	118081	118081	Elizabeth	82	" we will ask you no questions . "
118097	118101	118103	118103	Lydia	84	" Thank you , "
118105	118126	118103	118103	Lydia	84	" for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be so angry . "
118295	118301	118302	118302	she	82	" You may readily comprehend , "
118305	118385	118302	118302	she	82	" what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and , comparatively speaking , a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . "
118386	118396	118397	118397	she	82	" Not that I _ shall _ , though , "
118408	118440	118403	118403	she	82	" and , my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "
118566	118576	120706	120707	Mr. Darcy	89	" Gracechurch Street , _ Sept. 6 _ . * /
118577	118581	120706	120707	Mr. Darcy	89	" My dear Niece ,
118582	120653	120706	120707	Mr. Darcy	89	" I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a _ little _ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you . I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from _ you _ . Do n't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side . If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . Your uncle is as much surprised as I am ; and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . Mr. Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ yours _ seems to have been . He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both -- Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world . His character was to speak for itself . He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . If he _ had another _ motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs. Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . She then took a large house in Edward Street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . Wickham , indeed , had gone to her on their first arrival in London ; and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . They were in ---- Street . He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia . His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance as far as it would go . But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . She cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving Wickham . She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt had never been _ his _ design . He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydia 's flight on her own folly alone . He meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once . Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . Wickham , of course , wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . Everything being settled between _ them _ , Mr. Darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch Street the evening before I came home . But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen ; and Mr. Darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former . He did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . On Saturday he came again . Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . They met again on Sunday , and then _ I _ saw him too . It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . But our visitor was very obstinate . I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _ this _ is the true one . Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . But , Lizzy , this must go no further than yourself , or Jane at most . You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her _ , and his commission purchased . The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . It was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that Wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . Perhaps there was some truth in _ this _ ; though I doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody 's _ reserve can be answerable for the event . But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _ another interest _ in the affair . When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . I believe I have now told you everything . It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . Lydia came to us , and Wickham had constant admission to the house . _ He _ was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _ her _ behaviour while she stayed with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane 's letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain . I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . I was sometimes quite provoked ; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return , and , as Lydia imformed you , attended the wedding . He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him ? His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that _ , if he marry _ prudently _ , his wife may teach him . I thought him very sly ; he hardly ever mentioned your name . But slyness seems the fashion . Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . A low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing . But I must write no more . The children have been wanting me this half hour .
120654	120659	120706	120707	Mr. Darcy	89	" Yours , very sincerely ,
120660	120664	120706	120707	Mr. Darcy	89	" M. GARDINER . "
121231	121245	121247	121247	he	136	" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? "
121254	121259	121260	121260	she	82	" You certainly do , "
121266	121279	121260	121260	she	82	" but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . "
121280	121306	121250	121250	he	136	" I should be sorry , indeed , if it were . _ We _ were always good friends , and now we are better . "
121307	121316	121260	121260	she	82	" True . Are the others coming out ? "
121317	121358	121250	121250	he	136	" I do not know . Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . And so , my dear sister , I find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . "
121365	121430	121250	121250	he	136	" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . But of course she did not mention my name to you . "
121431	121437	121250	121250	he	136	" Yes , she did . "
121438	121445	121250	121250	he	136	" And what did she say ? "
121446	121483	121250	121250	he	136	" That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well . At such a distance as _ that _ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "
121484	121487	121488	121488	he	2586	" Certainly , "
121507	121535	121250	121250	he	136	" I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . We passed each other several times . I wonder what he can be doing there . "
121536	121547	121549	121549	Elizabeth	82	" Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , "
121551	121567	121549	121549	Elizabeth	82	" It must be something particular to take him there at this time of year . "
121568	121592	121250	121250	he	136	" Undoubtedly . Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . "
121593	121603	121549	121549	Elizabeth	82	" Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "
121604	121611	121250	121250	he	136	" And do you like her ? "
121612	121616	121549	121549	Elizabeth	82	" Very much . "
121617	121663	121250	121250	he	136	" I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . When I last saw her , she was not very promising . I am very glad you liked her . I hope she will turn out well . "
121664	121680	121549	121549	Elizabeth	82	" I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "
121681	121691	121250	121250	he	136	" Did you go by the village of Kympton ? "
121692	121701	121549	121549	Elizabeth	82	" I do not recollect that we did . "
121702	121737	121250	121250	he	136	" I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had . A most delightful place ! Excellent parsonage - house ! It would have suited me in every respect . "
121738	121747	121549	121549	Elizabeth	82	" How should you have liked making sermons ? "
121748	121834	121250	121250	he	136	" Exceedingly well . I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . One ought not to repine ; but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! But it was not to be . Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance when you were in Kent ? "
121835	121869	121549	121549	Elizabeth	82	" I _ have _ heard from authority , which I thought _ as good _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "
121870	121896	121250	121250	he	136	" You have ! Yes , there was something in _ that _ ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . "
121897	121949	121549	121549	Elizabeth	82	" I _ did _ hear , too , that there was a time when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . "
121950	121980	121250	121250	he	136	" You did ! and it was not wholly without foundation . You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "
122028	122065	122016	122016	she	2589	" Come , Mr. Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . Do not let us quarrel about the past . In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . "
122193	122200	122201	122201	she	85	" Oh , my dear Lydia , "
122204	122211	122201	122201	she	85	" when shall we meet again ? "
122212	122231	122289	122289	his	136	" Oh , Lord ! I do n't know . Not these two or three years , perhaps . "
122232	122242	122201	122201	she	85	" Write to me very often , my dear . "
122243	122279	122289	122289	his	136	" As often as I can . But you know married women have never much time for writing . My sisters may write to _ me _ . They will have nothing else to do . "
122305	122313	122315	122316	Mr. Bennet	75	" He is as fine a fellow , "
122328	122372	122315	122316	Mr. Bennet	75	" as ever I saw . He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . I am prodigiously proud of him . I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son - in - law . "
122387	122392	122394	122394	she	85	" I often think , "
122396	122417	122394	122394	she	85	" that there is nothing so bad as parting with one 's friends . One seems so forlorn without them . "
122418	122434	122436	122436	Elizabeth	82	" This is the consequence , you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , "
122438	122452	122436	122436	Elizabeth	82	" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "
122453	122498	122394	122394	she	85	" It is no such thing . Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband 's regiment happens to be so far off . If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . "
122594	122609	122578	122578	She	85	" Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , "
122621	122721	122578	122578	She	85	" Well , so much the better . Not that I care about it , though . He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . And who knows what _ may _ happen ? But that is nothing to us . You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . And so , it is quite certain he is coming ? "
122722	122729	122731	122732	the other	590	" You may depend on it , "
122734	122824	122731	122732	the other	590	" for Mrs. Nichols was in Meryton last night : I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certainly true . He comes down on Thursday , at the latest , very likely on Wednesday . She was going to the butcher 's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . "
122866	122983	122864	122864	she	84	" I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed ; but do n't imagine it was from any silly cause . I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I _ should _ be looked at . I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . Not that I am afraid of _ myself _ , but I dread other people 's remarks . "
123058	123064	123065	123065	she	82	" Yet it is hard , "
123069	123102	123065	123065	she	82	" that this poor man can not come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! I _ will _ leave him to himself . "
123176	123188	123190	123191	Mrs. Bennet	85	" As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , "
123193	123203	123190	123191	Mrs. Bennet	85	" you will wait on him , of course . "
123204	123255	123256	123256	His	2611	" No , no . You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool 's errand again . "
123281	123291	123293	123293	he	2611	" ' Tis an _ etiquette _ I despise , "
123295	123336	123293	123293	he	2611	" If he wants our society , let him seek it . He knows where we live . I will not spend _ my _ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . "
123337	123406	123412	123412	she	2614	" Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . But , however , that sha n't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon . That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "
123459	123471	123473	123473	Jane	83	" I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , "
123478	123542	123473	123473	Jane	83	" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference ; but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much I suffer from what she says . Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over ! "
123543	123554	123556	123556	Elizabeth	82	" I wish I could say anything to comfort you , "
123558	123594	123556	123556	Elizabeth	82	" but it is wholly out of my power . You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . "
123735	123745	123747	123747	Kitty	86	" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , "
123749	123755	123747	123747	Kitty	86	" who can it be ? "
123756	123776	123720	123720	she	82	" Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . "
123777	123780	123782	123782	Kitty	86	" La ! "
123784	123811	123782	123782	Kitty	86	" it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . Mr. what 's his name -- that tall , proud man . "
123812	123857	123858	123858	Jane	83	" Good gracious ! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does , I vow . Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley 's will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . "
124166	124175	124177	124177	she	83	" Let me first see how he behaves , "
124179	124189	124177	124177	she	83	" it will then be early enough for expectation . "
124632	124641	124643	124643	she	82	" Could I expect it to be otherwise ? "
124645	124652	124643	124643	she	82	" Yet why did he come ? "
124687	124702	124704	124705	Mrs. Bennet	85	" It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , "
124713	124899	124707	124707	He	89	" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . People _ did _ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away . Miss Lucas is married and settled : and one of my own daughters . I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . It was in the ' Times ' and the ' Courier , ' I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . It was only said , ' Lately , George Wickham , Esq . , to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or anything . It was my brother Gardiner 's drawing up , too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . Did you see it ? "
124931	124949	124951	124952	her mother	241	" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , "
124954	125051	124951	124952	her mother	241	" but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken away from me . They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the Regulars . Thank heaven ! he has _ some _ friends , though , perhaps , not so many as he deserves . "
125123	125136	125138	125139	her mother	241	" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr. Bingley , "
125141	125185	125138	125139	her mother	241	" I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet 's manor . I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the coveys for you . "
125255	125263	125265	125265	she	82	" The first wish of my heart , "
125269	125308	125265	125265	she	82	" is never more to be in company with either of them . Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! Let me never see either one or the other again ! "
125481	125494	125495	125495	she	85	" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , "
125498	125551	125495	125495	she	85	" for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned . I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "
125692	125708	125710	125710	she	82	" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , "
125712	125719	125710	125710	she	82	" did he come at all ? "
125732	125792	125793	125793	Her	82	" He could be still amiable , still pleasing to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? If he fears me , why come hither ? If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? Teasing , teasing man ! I will think no more about him . "
125827	125830	125832	125832	she	328	" Now , "
125834	125893	125832	125832	she	328	" that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . I am glad he dines here on Tuesday . It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "
125894	125902	125904	125904	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , very indifferent , indeed , "
125908	125916	125904	125904	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , Jane ! take care . "
125917	125936	125832	125832	she	328	" My dear Lizzy , you can not think me so weak as to be in danger now . "
125937	125958	125904	125904	Elizabeth	82	" I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "
126500	126513	126515	126515	she	82	" If he does not come to me , _ then _ , "
126517	126526	126515	126515	she	82	" I shall give him up for ever . "
126617	126640	126600	126603	one of the girls	2686	" The men sha n't come and part us , I am determined . We want none of them ; do we ? "
126687	126744	126681	126681	herself	82	" A man who has once been refused ! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? Is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings . "
126770	126778	126764	126764	she	82	" Is your sister at Pemberley still ? "
126779	126789	126764	126764	she	82	" Yes ; she will remain there till Christmas . "
126790	126802	126764	126764	she	82	" And quite alone ? Have all her friends left her ? "
126803	126822	126764	126764	she	82	" Mrs. Annesley is with her . The others have been gone on to Scarborough these three weeks . "
127032	127037	127039	127039	she	85	" Well , girls , "
127050	127240	127039	127039	she	85	" what say you to the day ? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . The venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases ' last week ; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least . And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . And what do you think she said besides ? ' Ah ! Mrs. Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last ! ' She did , indeed . I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . "
127315	127324	127326	127327	Miss Bennet	84	" It has been a very agreeable day , "
127331	127354	127326	127327	Miss Bennet	84	" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . I hope we may often meet again . "
127358	127452	127355	127355	Elizabeth	82	" Lizzy , you must not do so . You must not suspect me . It mortifies me . I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it . I am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . "
127453	127459	127461	127462	her sister	328	" You are very cruel , "
127464	127481	127461	127462	her sister	328	" you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . "
127482	127516	127355	127355	Elizabeth	82	" How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! And how impossible in others ! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? "
127517	127566	127461	127462	her sister	328	" That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _ me _ your confidante . "
127644	127650	127652	127652	she	85	" Next time you call , "
127654	127663	127652	127652	she	85	" I hope we shall be more lucky . "
127697	127705	127720	127720	her	85	" Can you come to - morrow ? "
127771	127828	127748	127749	Mrs. Bennet	85	" My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . He is come -- Mr. Bingley is come . He is , indeed . Make haste , make haste . Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . Never mind Miss Lizzy 's hair . "
127829	127840	127842	127842	Jane	83	" We will be down as soon as we can , "
127844	127866	127842	127842	Jane	83	" but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went upstairs half an hour ago . "
127867	127897	127900	127900	her	83	" Oh ! hang Kitty ! what has she to do with it ? Come , be quick , be quick ! where is your sash , my dear ? "
128007	128030	128002	128002	she	86	" What is the matter , mamma ? What do you keep winking at me for ? What am I to do ? "
128031	128045	128046	128046	She	85	" Nothing , child , nothing . I did not wink at you . "
128072	128086	128063	128063	she	85	" Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , "
128137	128150	128128	128129	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . "
128157	128170	128172	128173	her mother	241	" We may as well leave them by themselves , you know , "
128183	128198	128172	128173	her mother	241	" Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . "
128763	128769	128770	128770	she	83	" ' Tis too much ! "
128773	128794	128770	128770	she	83	" by far too much . I do not deserve it . Oh , why is not everybody as happy ? "
128855	128864	128865	128865	she	82	" I must go instantly to my mother , "
128868	128930	128865	128865	she	82	" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude , or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself . He is gone to my father already . Oh , Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall I bear so much happiness ? "
128992	128996	128998	128998	she	82	" And this , "
129000	129031	128998	128998	she	82	" is the end of all his friend 's anxious circumspection ! of all his sister 's falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , and most reasonable end ! "
129055	129061	129063	129063	he	79	" Where is your sister ? "
129072	129090	129091	129091	He	79	" With my mother upstairs . She will be down in a moment , I dare say . "
129362	129377	129355	129355	he	75	" Jane , I congratulate you . You will be a very happy woman . "
129394	129401	129402	129402	he	75	" You are a good girl , "
129405	129478	129402	129402	he	75	" and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . Your tempers are by no means unlike . You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "
129479	129499	129512	129513	his wife	231	" I hope not so . Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in _ me _ . "
129500	129510	129512	129513	his wife	231	" Exceed their income ! My dear Mr. Bennet , "
129515	129538	129512	129513	his wife	231	" what are you talking of ? Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . "
129544	129647	129512	129513	his wife	231	" Oh , my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! I am sure I sha n't get a wink of sleep all night . I knew how it would be . I always said it must be so , at last . I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . Oh , he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "
129860	129868	129870	129870	she	83	" He has made me so happy , "
129875	129899	129870	129870	she	83	" by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! I had not believed it possible . "
129900	129906	129908	129908	Elizabeth	82	" I suspected as much , "
129910	129919	129870	129870	she	83	" But how did he account for it ? "
129920	130009	129870	129870	she	83	" It must have been his sisters ' doing . They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again : though we can never be what we once were to each other . "
130010	130018	130020	130020	Elizabeth	82	" That is the most unforgiving speech , "
130022	130053	130020	130020	Elizabeth	82	" that I ever heard you utter . Good girl ! It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley 's pretended regard . "
130054	130094	129870	129870	she	83	" Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ? "
130095	130116	130020	130020	Elizabeth	82	" He made a little mistake , to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "
130184	130196	130198	130198	Jane	83	" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! "
130200	130239	130198	130198	Jane	83	" Oh , Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ? If I could but see you as happy ! If there were but such another man for you ! "
130240	130306	130322	130323	Mrs. Bennet	85	" If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you . Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time . "
130722	130742	130714	130714	she	85	" I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . That lady , I suppose , is your mother ? "
130751	130766	130714	130714	she	85	" And _ that _ , I suppose , is one of your sisters ? "
130767	130772	130774	130775	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes , madam , "
130785	130831	130774	130775	Mrs. Bennet	85	" She is my youngest girl but one . My youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the ground , walking with a young man , who , I believe , will soon become a part of the family . "
130832	130841	130843	130844	Lady Catherine	86	" You have a very small park here , "
130851	130883	130907	130908	Mrs. Bennet	85	" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my Lady , I dare say ; but , I assure you , it is much larger than Sir William Lucas 's . "
130884	130906	130907	130908	Mrs. Bennet	85	" This must be a most inconvenient sitting - room for the evening in summer : the windows are full west . "
130922	130941	130907	130908	Mrs. Bennet	85	" May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well ? "
130942	130956	130907	130908	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes , very well . I saw them the night before last . "
131032	131074	131031	131031	Elizabeth,--	159	" Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "
131075	131081	131083	131084	her mother	241	" Go , my dear , "
131086	131106	131083	131084	her mother	241	" and show her Ladyship about the different walks . I think she will be pleased with the hermitage . "
131223	131234	131236	131236	she	82	" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? "
131260	131295	131253	131254	Lady Catherine	86	" You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . "
131302	131328	131253	131254	Lady Catherine	86	" Indeed , you are mistaken , madam ; I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "
131329	131333	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" Miss Bennet , "
131343	131516	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" you ought to know that I am not to be trifled with . But however insincere _ you _ may choose to be , you shall not find _ me _ so . My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness ; and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago . I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _ you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew -- my own nephew , Mr. Darcy . Though I _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood , though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . "
131517	131527	131529	131529	Elizabeth	82	" If you believed it impossible to be true , "
131537	131557	131529	131529	Elizabeth	82	" I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . What could your Ladyship propose by it ? "
131558	131571	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . "
131572	131585	131587	131587	Elizabeth	82	" Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , "
131590	131610	131587	131587	Elizabeth	82	" will be rather a confirmation of it -- if , indeed , such a report is in existence . "
131611	131645	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" If ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "
131646	131654	131587	131587	Elizabeth	82	" I never heard that it was . "
131655	131672	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" And can you likewise declare , that there is no _ foundation _ for it ? "
131673	131702	131587	131587	Elizabeth	82	" I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship . _ You _ may ask questions which _ I _ shall not choose to answer . "
131703	131734	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" This is not to be borne . Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "
131735	131745	131587	131587	Elizabeth	82	" Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "
131746	131804	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . But _ your _ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . You may have drawn him in . "
131805	131820	131587	131587	Elizabeth	82	" If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . "
131821	131865	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? I have not been accustomed to such language as this . I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . "
131866	131891	131587	131587	Elizabeth	82	" But you are not entitled to know _ mine _ ; nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit . "
131892	131938	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" Let me be rightly understood . This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . No , never . Mr. Darcy is engaged to _ my daughter _ . Now , what have you to say ? "
131939	131962	131587	131587	Elizabeth	82	" Only this,--that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "
131973	132117	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . It was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of hers . While in their cradles we planned the union ; and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends -- to his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh ? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "
132118	132226	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" Yes ; and I had heard it before . But what is that to me ? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh . You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage . Its completion depended on others . If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? "
132227	132307	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" Because honour , decorum , prudence -- nay , interest -- forbid it . Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "
132308	132314	132316	132316	Elizabeth	82	" These are heavy misfortunes , "
132318	132352	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . "
132353	132444	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" Obstinate , headstrong girl ! I am ashamed of you ! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? Is nothing due to me on that score ? Let us sit down . You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it . I have not been used to submit to any person 's whims . I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . "
132445	132471	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" _ That _ will make your Ladyship 's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _ me _ . "
132472	132615	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" I will not be interrupted ! Hear me in silence . My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . They are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father 's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled , families . Their fortune on both sides is splendid . They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune ! Is this to be endured ? But it must not , shall not be ! If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . "
132616	132650	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman 's daughter ; so far we are equal . "
132651	132685	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" True . You _ are _ a gentleman 's daughter . But what was your mother ? Who are your uncles and aunts ? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . "
132686	132693	132695	132695	Elizabeth	82	" Whatever my connections may be , "
132697	132716	132695	132695	Elizabeth	82	" if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . "
132717	132731	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" Tell me , once for all , are you engaged to him ? "
132762	132767	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" I am not . "
132773	132787	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement ? "
132788	132798	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" I will make no promise of the kind . "
132799	132848	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" Miss Bennet , I am shocked and astonished . I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede . I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require . "
132849	133028	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" And I certainly _ never _ shall give it . I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make _ their _ marriage at all more probable ? Supposing him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these . How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _ his _ affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no further on the subject . "
133029	133157	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" Not so hasty , if you please . I have by no means done . To all the objections I have already urged I have still another to add . I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous elopement . I know it all ; that the young man 's marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expense of your father and uncle . And is _ such _ a girl to be my nephew 's sister ? Is _ her _ husband , who is the son of his late father 's steward , to be his brother ? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking ? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? "
133158	133170	133171	133171	she	2814	" You can _ now _ have nothing further to say , "
133175	133195	133171	133171	she	2814	" You have insulted me , in every possible method . I must beg to return to the house . "
133219	133259	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? "
133260	133276	133203	133204	Lady Catherine	86	" Lady Catherine , I have nothing further to say . You know my sentiments . "
133277	133286	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" You are then resolved to have him ? "
133287	133334	133203	133204	Lady Catherine	86	" I have said no such thing . I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _ you _ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "
133335	133386	131335	131336	her Ladyship	3464	" It is well . You refuse , then , to oblige me . You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "
133387	133397	133399	133399	Elizabeth	82	" Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , "
133401	133483	133399	133399	Elizabeth	82	" has any possible claim on me , in the present instance . No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy . And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment 's concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . "
133484	133547	133571	133571	she	86	" And this is your real opinion ! This is your final resolve ! Very well . I shall now know how to act . Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . I came to try you . I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . "
133573	133604	133571	133571	she	86	" I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . I send no compliments to your mother . You deserve no such attention . I am most seriously displeased . "
133668	133675	133677	133678	her daughter	463	" She did not choose it , "
133680	133685	133677	133678	her daughter	463	" she would go . "
133686	133760	133677	133678	her daughter	463	" She is a very fine - looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . She is on her road somewhere , I dare say ; and so , passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? "
134272	134294	134295	134295	she	82	" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , "
134298	134350	134295	134295	she	82	" I shall know how to understand it . I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . "
134433	134436	134438	134438	he	244	" Lizzy , "
134440	134454	134438	134438	he	244	" I was going to look for you : come into my room . "
134528	134583	134525	134525	He	244	" I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . I did not know before that I had _ two _ daughters on the brink of matrimony . Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . "
134642	134684	134639	134640	her father	244	" You look conscious . Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even _ your _ sagacity to discover the name of your admirer . This letter is from Mr. Collins . "
134685	134700	134611	134611	she	82	" From Mr. Collins ! and what can _ he _ have to say ? "
134701	135096	134639	134640	her father	244	" Something very much to the purpose , of course . He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases . I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point . What relates to yourself is as follows:--'Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another , of which we have been advertised by the same authority . Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her eldest sister has resigned it ; and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . ' Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? ' This young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with everything the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . Yet , in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . ' Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? But now it comes out . ' My motive for cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . ' _ Mr. Darcy _ , you see , is the man ! Now , Lizzy , I think I _ have _ surprised you . Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? Mr. Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _ you _ in his life ! It is admirable ! "
135131	135137	134611	134611	she	82	" Are you not diverted ? "
135138	135147	134611	134611	she	82	" Oh , yes . Pray read on . "
135148	135492	134611	134611	she	82	" ' After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that , on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . ' Mr. Collins , moreover , adds , ' I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . ' _ That _ is his notion of Christian forgiveness ! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte 's situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . You are not going to be _ missish _ , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "
135493	135496	135498	135498	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , "
135500	135512	135498	135498	Elizabeth	82	" I am exceedingly diverted . But it is so strange ! "
135513	135634	134611	134611	she	82	" Yes , _ that _ is what makes it amusing . Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference and _ your _ pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd ! Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr. Collins 's correspondence for any consideration . Nay , when I read a letter of his , I can not help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? Did she call to refuse her consent ? "
136000	136089	135997	135997	she	86	" Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature , and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours . I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . Were it known to the rest of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "
136090	136098	136100	136100	Darcy	89	" I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , "
136110	136144	136100	136100	Darcy	89	" that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted . "
136145	136226	135997	135997	she	86	" You must not blame my aunt . Lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . "
136227	136236	136237	136237	he	89	" If you _ will _ thank me , "
136240	136300	136237	136237	he	89	" let it be for yourself alone . That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . But your _ family _ owe me nothing . Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of _ you _ . "
136320	136370	136316	136317	her companion	1675	" You are too generous to trifle with me . If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . _ My _ affections and wishes are unchanged ; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "
136684	136691	136693	136693	he	1675	" It taught me to hope , "
136695	136740	136693	136693	he	1675	" as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly . "
136749	136791	136741	136741	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , you know enough of my _ frankness _ to believe me capable of _ that _ . After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "
136792	136845	136693	136693	he	1675	" What did you say of me that I did not deserve ? For though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . It was unpardonable . I can not think of it without abhorrence . "
136846	136862	136864	136864	Elizabeth	82	" We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , "
136866	136894	136864	136864	Elizabeth	82	" The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then we have both , I hope , improved in civility . "
136895	137005	136693	136693	he	1675	" I can not be so easily reconciled to myself . The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ' Had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ' Those were your words . You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me ; though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "
137006	137038	136864	136864	Elizabeth	82	" I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "
137039	137094	136693	136693	he	1675	" I can easily believe it . You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . "
137095	137128	136864	136864	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , do not repeat what I then said . These recollections will not do at all . I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "
137134	137138	137129	137129	Darcy	89	" Did it , "
137140	137166	137167	137167	She	2866	he,--"did it _ soon _ make you think better of me ? Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "
137188	137192	137194	137194	he	89	" I knew , "
137196	137255	137194	137194	he	89	" that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . I hope you have destroyed the letter . There was one part , especially the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . "
137256	137306	137129	137129	Darcy	89	" The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . "
137307	137314	137316	137316	Darcy	89	" When I wrote that letter , "
137318	137343	137316	137316	Darcy	89	" I believed myself perfectly calm and cool ; but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "
137344	137430	137129	137129	Darcy	89	" The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . The adieu is charity itself . But think no more of the letter . The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . You must learn some of my philosophy . Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "
137431	137743	137316	137316	Darcy	89	" I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . _ Your _ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of ignorance . But with _ me _ , it is not so . Painful recollections will intrude , which can not , which ought not to be repelled . I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . As a child I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper . I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only _ child _ ) , I was spoiled by my parents , who , though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _ wish _ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . Such I was , from eight to eight - and - twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do I not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . By you , I was properly humbled . I came to you without a doubt of my reception . You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "
137744	137754	138024	138024	He	89	" Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? "
137755	137779	137316	137316	Darcy	89	" Indeed I had . What will you think of my vanity ? I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "
137780	137825	138024	138024	He	89	" My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , I assure you . I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . How you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ! "
137826	137850	137316	137316	Darcy	89	" Hate you ! I was angry , perhaps , at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . "
137851	137875	138024	138024	He	89	" I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley . You blamed me for coming ? "
137876	137887	137316	137316	Darcy	89	" No , indeed , I felt nothing but surprise . "
137888	137933	138024	138024	He	89	" Your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you . My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . "
137934	137941	137943	137943	Darcy	89	" My object _ then _ , "
137945	138023	137943	137943	Darcy	89	" was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . How soon any other wishes introduced themselves , I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . "
138159	138170	138184	138184	Darcy	147	" What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ? "
138202	138211	138213	138213	Elizabeth	82	" I must ask whether you were surprised ? "
138215	138233	138213	138213	Elizabeth	82	" Not at all . When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . "
138234	138251	138254	138254	he	89	" That is to say , you had given your permission . I guessed as much . "
138271	138281	138283	138283	he	89	" On the evening before my going to London , "
138285	138387	138283	138283	he	89	" I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . His surprise was great . He had never had the slightest suspicion . I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . "
138402	138411	138413	138413	she	82	" Did you speak from your own observation , "
138415	138434	138413	138413	she	82	" when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? "
138435	138466	138394	138394	his	2873	" From the former . I had narrowly observed her , during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . "
138467	138483	138413	138413	she	82	" And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . "
138484	138605	138394	138394	his	2873	" It did . Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made everything easy . I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . He was angry . But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister 's sentiments . He has heartily forgiven me now . "
138694	138707	138691	138692	CHAPTER LIX	218	" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? "
138928	138962	138922	138922	she	82	" You are joking , Lizzy . This can not be ! Engaged to Mr. Darcy ! No , no , you shall not deceive me : I know it to be impossible . "
138963	139020	138922	138922	she	82	" This is a wretched beginning , indeed ! My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . I speak nothing but the truth . He still loves me , and we are engaged . "
139027	139045	139021	139021	Jane	83	" Oh , Lizzy ! it can not be . I know how much you dislike him . "
139046	139101	138922	138922	she	82	" You know nothing of the matter . _ That _ is all to be forgot . Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now ; but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable . This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . "
139122	139139	139141	139141	Jane	83	" Good heaven ! can it be really so ? Yet now I must believe you , "
139143	139179	139141	139141	Jane	83	" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would , I do congratulate you ; but are you certain -- forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "
139180	139223	139109	139109	Elizabeth	82	" There can be no doubt of that . It is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . But are you pleased , Jane ? Shall you like to have such a brother ? "
139224	139287	139141	139141	Jane	83	" Very , very much . Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . And do you really love him quite well enough ? Oh , Lizzy ! do anything rather than marry without affection . Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? "
139288	139313	139109	139109	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , yes ! You will only think I feel _ more _ than I ought to do when I tell you all . "
139314	139320	139141	139141	Jane	83	" What do you mean ? "
139321	139345	139109	139109	Elizabeth	82	" Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley . I am afraid you will be angry . "
139346	139389	139141	139141	Jane	83	" My dearest sister , now be , _ be _ serious . I want to talk very seriously . Let me know everything that I am to know without delay . Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "
139390	139424	139109	139109	Elizabeth	82	" It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began ; but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . "
139466	139473	139475	139475	she	2886	" Now I am quite happy , "
139477	139579	139475	139475	she	2886	" for you will be as happy as myself . I always had a value for him . Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . But , Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . "
139644	139648	139650	139651	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Good gracious ! "
139663	139746	139654	139654	she	85	" if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? I had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . What shall we do with him ? Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley 's way . "
139810	139832	139804	139804	he	79	" Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? "
139833	139845	139847	139848	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , "
139850	139875	139847	139848	Mrs. Bennet	85	" to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . "
139876	139886	139888	139889	Mr. Bingley	79	" It may do very well for the others , "
139891	139910	139888	139889	Mr. Bingley	79	" but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . Wo n't it , Kitty ? "
139953	140018	139947	139948	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself ; but I hope you will not mind it . It is all for Jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then ; so do not put yourself to inconvenience . "
140291	140304	140305	140305	She	82	" Go to your father ; he wants you in the library . "
140323	140326	140328	140328	he	244	" Lizzy , "
140330	140355	140328	140328	he	244	" what are you doing ? Are you out of your senses to be accepting this man ? Have not you always hated him ? "
140415	140457	140400	140400	she	82	" Or , in other words , you are determined to have him . He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . But will they make you happy ? "
140458	140465	140467	140467	Elizabeth	82	" Have you any other objection , "
140469	140477	140467	140467	Elizabeth	82	" than your belief of my indifference ? "
140478	140508	140400	140400	she	82	" None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "
140509	140518	140519	140519	she	82	" I do , I do like him , "
140528	140568	140519	140519	she	82	" I love him . Indeed he has no improper pride . He is perfectly amiable . You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "
140569	140572	140574	140575	her father	244	" Lizzy , "
140577	140725	140574	140575	her father	244	" I have given him my consent . He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse anything , which he condescended to ask . I now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him . But let me advise you to think better of it . I know your disposition , Lizzy . I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband , unless you looked up to him as a superior . Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . My child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life . You know not what you are about . "
140822	140828	140830	140830	he	89	" Well , my dear , "
140837	140871	140830	140830	he	89	" I have no more to say . If this be the case , he deserves you . I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . "
140897	141011	140893	140893	her	82	" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! And so , Darcy did everything ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission ! So much the better . It will save me a world of trouble and economy . Had it been your uncle 's doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way . I shall offer to pay him to - morrow , he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "
141052	141074	141047	141047	she	82	" If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . "
141271	141422	141244	141244	She	85	" Good gracious ! Lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr. Darcy ! Who would have thought it ? And is it really true ? Oh , my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! Jane 's is nothing to it -- nothing at all . I am so pleased -- so happy . Such a charming man ! so handsome ! so tall ! Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before . I hope he will overlook it . Dear , dear Lizzy . A house in town ! Everything that is charming ! Three daughters married ! Ten thousand a year ! Oh , Lord ! what will become of me ? I shall go distracted . "
141471	141476	141477	141477	she	241	" My dearest child , "
141480	141548	141477	141477	she	241	" I can think of nothing else . Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! ' Tis as good as a lord ! And a special licence -- you must and shall be married by a special licence . But , my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . "
141688	141701	141703	141703	he	75	" I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , "
141705	141731	141703	141703	he	75	" Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as Jane 's . "
141760	141766	141768	141768	she	82	" How could you begin ? "
141770	141798	141768	141768	she	82	" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "
141799	141846	141744	141744	she	82	" I can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . It is too long ago . I was in the middle before I knew that I _ had _ begun . "
141847	141905	141768	141768	she	82	" My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . Now , be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "
141906	141916	141744	141744	she	82	" For the liveliness of your mind I did . "
141917	142091	141768	141768	she	82	" You may as well call it impertinence at once . It was very little less . The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone . I roused and interested you , because I was so unlike _ them _ . Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it : but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . There -- I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . To be sure you know no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . "
142092	142111	141744	141744	she	82	" Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? "
142112	142237	141768	141768	she	82	" Dearest Jane ! who could have done less for her ? But make a virtue of it by all means . My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly , by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last ? What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "
142238	142252	141744	141744	she	82	" Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "
142253	142259	141768	141768	she	82	" But I was embarrassed . "
142260	142265	141744	141744	she	82	" And so was I. "
142266	142280	141768	141768	she	82	" You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "
142281	142290	141744	141744	she	82	" A man who had felt less might . "
142291	142409	141768	141768	she	82	" How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! But I wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . I wonder when you _ would _ have spoken if I had not asked you ! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . _ Too much _ , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? This will never do . "
142410	142491	141744	141744	she	82	" You need not distress yourself . The moral will be perfectly fair . Lady Catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . I was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours . My aunt 's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know everything . "
142492	142549	141768	141768	she	82	" Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequences ? "
142550	142620	141744	141744	she	82	" My real purpose was to see _ you _ , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . "
142621	142638	141768	141768	she	82	" Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her ? "
142639	142675	141744	141744	she	82	" I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . But it ought to be done ; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly . "
142676	142724	141768	141768	she	82	" And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "
142793	143019	143022	143023	Mr. Darcy	89	" I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory detail of particulars ; but , to say the truth , I was too cross to write . You supposed more than really existed . But _ now _ suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . I thank you again and again , for not going to the Lakes . How could I be so silly as to wish it ! Your idea of the ponies is delightful . We will go round the park every day . I am the happiest creature in the world . Perhaps other people have said so before , but no one with such justice . I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me . You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . Yours , "
143057	143062	143022	143023	Mr. Darcy	89	" Dear Sir , * /
143063	143111	143042	143043	Mr. Bennet	75	" I must trouble you once more for congratulations . Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy . Console Lady Catherine as well as you can . But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . He has more to give .
143112	143116	143119	143120	Miss Bingley	91	" Yours sincerely , "
144198	144204	144164	144164	Lydia	84	" My dear Lizzy , * /
144205	144322	144339	144339	she	82	" I wish you joy . If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . It is a great comfort to have you so rich ; and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much ; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not .
144323	144326	144164	144164	Lydia	84	" Yours , "
